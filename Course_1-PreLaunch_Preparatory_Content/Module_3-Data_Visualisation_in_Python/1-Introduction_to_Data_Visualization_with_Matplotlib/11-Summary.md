# Summary

This session introduced you to the world of data visualisation. Throughout this session, you performed visualisations using Matplotlib. Now, let's summarise all that you learnt in this session.

**VIDEO**

You started this session by understanding the importance of visualisation in interpreting data. Then you learnt about the different types of graphs and charts, namely:

- Bar chart
- Scatter plot
- Line graph
- Histogram
- Box plot

Further, you learnt about the elements that help display additional information about a plot. Also, you learnt how to fit several subplots inside a single plot object, which is useful for comparing different properties or elements of your data.
