# Introduction to Matplotlib

**Data visualisation** is an important skill to possess for anyone trying to extract and communicate insights from data. Great business narratives and presentations often stem from brilliant visualisations that convey the key ideas in a concise and aesthetic manner. In the field of machine learning, visualisation plays a key role throughout the entire process of analysis - to obtain relationships, observe trends and portray the final results as well. Therefore, it is imperative that you learn and master this tool which will aid you throughout this program.

This session will help you learn how to visualise data in Python using the **Matplotlib** library.

In the previous module, you learnt how to handle numerical data using the NumPy library. You could load data in the form of arrays and then perform operations on the same. In this session, we will try to visualise the arrays using another library in Python, namely, **Matplotlib**.

Data visualisation is a crucial step in the process of data analysis; in the upcoming video, letâ€™s hear it out from Behzad how visualisation could play the most crucial role for your data toolkit.
