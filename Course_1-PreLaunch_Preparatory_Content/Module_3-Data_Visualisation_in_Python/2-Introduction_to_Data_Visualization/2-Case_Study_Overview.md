# Case Study Overview

As explained earlier, you’ll be learning this session with the help of a case study. This will enable you to understand how data visualisation aids you in solving business problems. Let’s listen to Rahim as he introduces the problem statement and our objectives for the same.

As you learnt in the video, the team at Google Play Store wants to develop a feature that would enable them to boost visibility for the most promising apps. Now, this analysis would require a preliminary understanding of the features that define a well-performing app. For which, you can ask questions like:

- Does a higher size or price of an app necessarily mean that it would perform better than the other apps?
- Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?

 You'll learn to use data visualisation to answer these questions and derive corresponding insights. Let’s take a quick look at the dataset in the following video:

[**Note**: The dataset has already been provided to you in the earlier segment along with the Jupyter notebook file. Please go through the section on 'How to go through this module' from the [Case Study: Mind Map](https://learn.upgrad.com/v/course/1126/session/104242/segment/581780) segment]

The above dataset has already been provided to you in the earlier segment along with the Jupyter notebook file.

Here’s a small sample of apps present in the dataset along with their corresponding headers.

You’re advised to go through the dataset on your own and get an understanding of the various features and data points available there. From the next segment onwards, you’ll begin with the hands-on demonstration in Python.

#### Target Variable

Qn: In the world of machine learning, the target variable is defined as the variable or column in a dataset whose value is to be predicted or analysed by using the other variables in the same dataset. For our case study, can you guess which of the following is the target variable?  

- App

- Size

- Content Rating

- Rating

Ans: D. *You want to analyse the data set to find out the features that determine whether an app is performing well or not in ratings. Therefore, the Rating column is our target variable. You’ll be analysing the way the rating varies across different categories of other variables to determine the most important indicators for the high-performing apps.*
