# Summary

You may decide to go through the solutions to the previous segment of practice problems before we summarize the learnings from the session.

[Note: If you get a **"SettingWithCopyWarning"** in any part of the solution code, do check on its implications and how you can avoid it from the [link](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/) here]

Here’s a summary of what you have learnt so far in this very intense session:

- First, you began with understanding the necessity of visualisation using the example of Anscombe’s Quartet. There, you saw four different data sets having the same exact summary statistics but completely different visual plots.

- After that, you saw some examples of data visualisation which enabled you to understand how effective visualisations can portray insights elegantly.

- Next, you began your data visualisation journey with the help of a case study. Here, you had to analyse the ratings of various Google Play Store apps in order to determine the features that decide whether an app is performing well.

- In the beginning, you performed some basic data-handling and cleaning tasks using your knowledge of Python libraries, which you have learnt earlier. You converted data types, cleaning certain columns containing erroneous entries, and even deleted records having a lot of null values.

- After that, you learnt how visualisation tools like box plots and histograms can help you with certain data-cleaning and analysis tasks. Box plots are required for understanding the spread of a numeric variable and identifying extreme values or outliers.

- After that, you learnt about histograms, and how you can use them for analysing a numeric variable by dividing them to certain bins and then finding the frequency, or the number of records in each bin.

- Then you also learnt how to manipulate the number of bins to obtain more granular results as shown in the figure below:

- You performed the above analysis for the Reviews, Size and Installs columns, and along with the box plot, you decided to keep only certain records for analysis.

**In the next session**

With this, you have completed the basic data-handling and cleaning tasks. In the next session, you’ll begin your journey of the Seaborn library, and use its visual tools to obtain insights and answer the business questions that were asked earlier while discussing the case study objectives.
