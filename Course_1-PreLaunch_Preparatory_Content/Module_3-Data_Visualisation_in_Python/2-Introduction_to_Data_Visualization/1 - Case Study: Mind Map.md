# Case Study: Mind Map

Now that you have understood why data visualisation is crucial in drawing insights, let’s listen to Rahim as he gives a brief overview of this module.

**VIDEO**

Here’s a brief mindmap of the contents of this module.

- In the next segment, you’ll start working with a case study: **Analysing the Google Play Store Ratings Dataset**. Here, you’ll start with some basic data wrangling techniques, which you would have learnt in the previous modules 
- For the data visualisation part, you’ll be revisiting the concepts of **Matplotlib**, which you learnt in the last session of the previous module. Then you’ll be introduced to the popular **Seaborn** library, which gives you access to a lot of flexible and aesthetic plotting methods. 
- Towards the end of the module, you’ll also get a brief exposure to the library ‘**Plotly**’, which is another visualisation library that helps you make beautiful interactive charts in Python.

## **HOW TO GO THROUGH THIS MODULE**

For the case study demonstration, you are encouraged to code along with the SME as he explains each step in the video lectures. This will help you get a strong grip on the various tenets for analysing datasets and to think like a data scientist in any scenario. Also, this notebook will help with your reference to revise any specific concepts with respect to this module. The code stub has been provided and you can download the same from the link below.

When you open the stub file it will look something like the image shown below (Open the image in a new tab to magnify it even further)

As you can see it's a commented notebook containing the following main items

- **Commented Instructions** - For each of the coding steps that the SME will be performing while going through the case study, instructions have been provided corresponding for each step in the form of comments. Your task is to code along with the SME and fill the notebook as per the specified comments.
- **Topic Summary** - For each of the topics that is being taught in this module, a brief summary has been provided in the notebook as well. This way, before performing each step, you can have a quick look at the theory to understand what type of steps you are performing and why.

This notebook has been designed to give you ample practice as well as act as a revision resource. Therefore, it is advised that you go through the coding videos once or twice till you get a good amount of practice as this will come in handy when you move forward in this program.

For the coding practice questions in this module, you also will be provided with a Jupyter Notebook containing instructions and lines of code. You’re expected to solve the questions at the respective places in the Notebook and then choose the correct answer on the platform. The Notebook already contains the code to import datasets.

**Note: A sample completed notebook containing the entire analysis done for the entire case study will be made available to you at the end of the module.**
