# Introduction to Pandas

**Pandas** is a library specifically for data analysis; it is built using NumPy. You will be using Pandas extensively for data manipulation, data visualisation, building machine learning models, etc. In the following video, letâ€™s hear from Behzad as he explains the topics that will be covered in this session.

**VIDEO**

As mentioned in this video, Pandas is one of the most used libraries in Python, and this is because of the powerful data constructs that it offers. You will learn about the data constructs as you move ahead in the session. But first, to initialise the Pandas library, you can use the following command:

`import pandas as pd`

In this session, you will learn about the following topics:

- Creating dataframes
- Importing CSV data files as Pandas dataframes
- Reading and summarising dataframes
- Sorting dataframes
- Labelling, indexing and slicing data
- Merging dataframes using joins
- Pivoting and grouping

## Guidelines for coding console questions

The lectures are interspersed with coding consoles to help you practise writing Python code. You will be given a brief problem statement and some pre-written code. You can write the code in the provided space, verify your answer using test cases and submit it when you are confident about it.

Note that the coding console questions are non-graded. Some instructions for these questions are as follows:

- Ignore the pre-written code on the console. Please do not change it.
- Write your answer only in the space where you are asked to write.
- You may run and verify any number of times.
