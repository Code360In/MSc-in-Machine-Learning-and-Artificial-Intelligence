Let's summarise what you have learnt in this session. You learnt about the Pandas library, which provides various functions to conduct data analysis in Python.

The various topics that were covered in this session are as follows:

- Pandas Series and Dataframes, which are the basic data structures in the Pandas library
- Indexing, selecting and subsetting a dataframe
- Merging and appending two dataframes, which can be done using the .merge and .concat commands
- Grouping and summarising dataframes, which can be done using groupby() to first make an object and then use it to play around
- The pivot table function in a dataframe, which is similar to pivot tables in MS Excel
- Finally, you learnt how to perform different functions over time-series data using Pandas

Congratulations on the completion of the first two modules! In the next module, you will learn more about data visualisation using another library of Python - Seaborn.
