# Mathematical Operations on NumPy II

The objective of this segment is to discuss the mathematical capabilities of NumPy. Note that these mathematical functions might not be of direct use to you. In actual practice as a data scientist, you might not use these functions, but the advanced functions that you will use will be built using these functions. So, it would help if you remember that the NumPy library has all of these capabilities.

Let’s watch the following video and understand the **trigonometric** capabilities of NumPy.

**VIDEO**

The next set of mathematical capabilities is **exponential** and **logarithmic** functions.

**VIDEO**

In the videos provided above, you learnt about the mathematical functions that can be directly calculated. Another important feature offered by NumPy is **empty arrays**, where you can initialise an empty array and later use it to store the output of your operations. In the next video, Behzad will explain how to create empty arrays and use them.

Once you have created an array, you may want to run aggregation operations on the data stored in it. An aggregation function helps you summarise the numerical data. Let's take a look at it in the following video.

**VIDEO**

Using the reduce() and accumulate() functions, you can easily summarise the data available in arrays. The reduce() function results in a single value, whereas the accumulate() function helps you apply your aggregation sequentially on each element of an array. These functions require a base function to aggregate the data, for example, add() in the case given above.

The last mathematical capability that we will discuss is the linear algebra module in the NumPy library. Linear algebra is a significantly used module in machine learning. You might not be expected to write code using the NumPy library, but the functions being used will depend on the functions demonstrated below. In the next video, you will learn about the linear algebra functions in detail.

**VIDEO**

In this video, you learnt about numerous functions, such as rank and the inverse of a matrix. Although NumPy can calculate the results of these functions, the operations need to be valid. For example, if it is not possible for a matrix to be inverted, then the NumPy inverse operations will throw an error. With this, we have come to the end of the demonstration of mathematical capabilities of the NumPy library. In the following video, let’s take a look at the summary of what you learnt in the previous segments.

In the next segment, we will have a detailed demonstration of computational speeds of NumPy arrays versus lists.
