# Summary

Let's summarise what you have learnt in this session.

**VIDEO**

In this session, you learnt about the most important package for scientific computing in Python: **NumPy**. The various operations that you learnt about include the following:

- Arrays, which are the basic data structures in the NumPy library
- Creating NumPy arrays from a list or a tuple
- Creating randomly large arrays, which can be done using the `arange` command
- Analysing the shape and dimension of an array using `array.shape`, `array.ndim`, etc.
- Indexing, slicing and subsetting an array, which is similar to indexing in lists
- Working on multidimensional arrays
- Manipulating arrays using `reshape()`, `hstack()` and `vstack()`

In the next session, you will take a look at a new library, pandas, which is used to manipulate heterogeneous data.
