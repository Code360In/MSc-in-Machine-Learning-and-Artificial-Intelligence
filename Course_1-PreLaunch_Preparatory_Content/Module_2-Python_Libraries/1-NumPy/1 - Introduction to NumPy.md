# Introduction to NumPy

Welcome to this module on **Python for Data Science**.

## In this module

You will learn about the two most important and popular Python libraries for handling data: **NumPy** and **Pandas**. In the following video, our SME, Behzad Ahmadi, will explain the contents of the module. 

**VIDEO**    

In this module, you will learn about the basics of NumPy, which is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy consists of a robust data structure called multidimensional arrays. Pandas is another powerful Python library that provides a fast and easy-to-use data analysis platform.

**Important Note**  
To enhance the learning outcome, you are expected to pause the videos and code along with the instructor. You will be provided with a structured and blank IPython notebook for coding. It is a must for you to answer certain in-segment questions, as they serve the purpose of practice, and the final notebook will have practice tasks for you to solve.

## Prerequisite for this module

The learners are expected to have gone through the module on ‘Introduction to Python’ before beginning with this module.

## In this session

In the following video, Behzad will talk about the scope of the session.

**VIDEO**    

You will understand the advantages of using NumPy. You will also learn how to:

- Create NumPy arrays,
- Convert lists and tuples to NumPy arrays,
- Inspect the structure and content of arrays, and
- Subset, slice, index and iterate through arrays.

Before we get into the technicalities of a NumPy array, explore its useful functions and understand how it is implemented in Python, it is crucial to understand **<u>why NumPy is an important library for working with data</u>.** 

NumPy, an acronym for the term ‘Numerical Python’, is a library in Python used extensively for efficient mathematical computing. This library allows users to store large amounts of data using less memory and perform extensive operations efficiently. It provides optimised and simpler functionalities to perform aforementioned operations using homogenous, one-dimensional and multidimensional arrays (You will learn more about this later.).

Now, before delving deep into the concept of NumPy arrays, it is important to note that Python lists can very well perform all the actions that NumPy arrays perform; it is simply the fact that NumPy arrays are faster and more convenient than lists when it comes to extensive computations, which make them extremely useful, especially when you are working with large amounts of data.

## Guidelines for coding console questions

The lectures are interspersed with coding consoles to help you practise writing Python code. You will be given a brief problem statement and some pre-written code. You can write the code in the provided space, verify your answer using test cases and submit it when you are confident about it.

Note that the coding console questions are non-graded. Some instructions for these questions are as follows:

- Ignore the pre-written code on the console. Please do not change it.
- Write your answer only in the space where you are asked to write.
- You may run and verify your code any number of times.
