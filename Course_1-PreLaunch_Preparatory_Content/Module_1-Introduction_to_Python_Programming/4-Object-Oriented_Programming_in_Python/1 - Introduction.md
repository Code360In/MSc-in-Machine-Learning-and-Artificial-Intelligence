# Introduction

Welcome to the fifth session on 'Object-Oriented Programming in Python'.

In this session, you will learn about the object-oriented programming concepts in python, which will help you in building different complex applications. Let us hear from Behzad about what object-oriented programming is all about -

In this session, we will be covering the important concepts of object-oriented programming, which you may come across while working in the field of Software Engineering. Object-oriented programming paradigm enables us to think in a natural way, it mimics the working of real-life entities or objects. 

**Note**: Please keep in mind that object-oriented programming is a world in itself and we are learning this paradigm in-order to get exposed to software engineering skills that might be required as part of the complex application building process.  This might be a reasonably challenging concept to grasp so; please do not feel disheartened if you find it difficult to follow now, you can always come back later to review the concepts, and with a few iterations, things will start making sense. Essentially, the depth of topics covered in this module is enough for you to work in the field of Data Science, but for the curious ones who wish to know more, we will be sharing curated resources at the end of this module.

You can open the link below to download the Python notebooks used in this session. We recommend that you keep executing the commands on your computer in pace with the lecture. You can parallelly try experimenting with other commands you may have in mind.
