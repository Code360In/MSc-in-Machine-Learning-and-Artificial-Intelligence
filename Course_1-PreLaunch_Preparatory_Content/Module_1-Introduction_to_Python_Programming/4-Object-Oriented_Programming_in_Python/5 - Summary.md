# Summary

Now that you have learnt all the basic concepts and techniques in python, you are ready to move further along on the programme. But before doing that, let us revise the concepts learnt as part of this module using the practice exercise given below:

In this exercise, you will need the concepts of object-oriented programming, control structures and fundamental arithmetic operations.

The concepts learnt as part of this module would be used to build an <u>Ice-Cream Sundae ordering application</u>, through which a user will be able to order an ice-cream or a customizable sundae. We will program the application to dynamically calculate the cost of the order based on the user's customization to the dessert.

Download the jupyter notebook linked below and get started. All the best!



It is highly recommended that you give the practice exercise your best shot. If you are facing any challenge with respect to any particular component, you could look at the solution to the exercise given below:



Now, let's summarise what you learnt in this session.

**VIDEO**

Overall in this module, in the first session, you started your learning journey in Python by writing your first program and then went on to see the different **data types** supported by Python and various **arithmetic** and **string** operations using the same. 

The second session was all about grasping concepts of different **data structures** supported by Python, where you learned in detail about **List**, **Tuples**, **Sets** and **Dictionary**.

The third session was about **control structures** and **functional programming** in Python, how **decision-making** statements and **loops** play an essential role etc.

Finally, in this session, you learnt about **classes**, **objects methods** and various OOP methodologies. You started from what are classes, what are objects, how these two are related, and how you implement methods. Moving further, you learnt in detail about one of the most crucial object-oriented programming methodology called '**inheritance**', how Python supports the same, and how do you override it using a method.

In the next module 'Python for Data Science', you will be learning in detail about Python libraries in Data Science where you will see Pandas, Numpy libraries supported by python, what are data frames and how to create and manipulate them.

## Additional Reading

With this module, you have now learnt the fundamental skills and syntaxes associated with the Python language. This knowledge is enough to learn the next main skill in Python - how to use Python for data-related tasks which is the central point of discussion for your next main module - Python for Data Science.

Apart from this, you can also use Python for general problem-solving. Think of it like this - when you are learning a new spoken-language, you first learn the alphabets, basic words, and the grammar (syntax) that binds them together. This knowledge then enables you to create structured sentences that help you express your thoughts. The learnings in this module were those alphabets, basic words, and syntaxes. The next step would be to leverage these entities to structurally create programs that could help you solve problems. You have, obviously, solved some basic problems in this module itself like repeating the same task for a large number of times using loops, or filtering out some values based on certain conditions using the filter() function, and even creating classes and objects that enable you to think like you're working with real-life entities. If you feel confident in these topics, you can proceed forward with some optional advance content in Python which helps you deploy your learnings till now to solve larger problems structurally.
