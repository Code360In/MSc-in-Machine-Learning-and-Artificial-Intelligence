# Introduction

Welcome to the third session on '**Control Structures and Functions**'.

Control structures are the essence of programming; they help computers do what they do best: automate repetitive tasks intelligently. The most common control structures are **if-else** statements, **for** and **while** loops, and list and dictionary comprehensions. This session will cover all these concepts.

Another crucial thing you will learn in this session is how to write your own functions. Almost every powerful program, be it a web app or a machine learning algorithm, is a set of functions written to perform specific tasks.

In this session, we will first cover control structures followed by 'Functions in Python'. Control structures are used to control the order of execution of a program on the basis of logic and values. Also, a function is a set of statements that takes input, does some computation, and returns an output. Instead of writing a set of commonly-used tasks repeatedly, we can simply write a function and call it. We will be covering both these concepts in-depth, and you will be given practice exercises to assimilate the concepts learnt. This is a reasonably challenging topic; hence, we recommend going through the content a few times before attempting the practice exercise to gain a better grasp on the subject matter.

In this session, you will learn

- Control structures

  - If-elif-else

  - For loop

  - While loop

  - List comprehensions

  - Dictionary comprehensions

- Functions

- Map

- Filter

- Reduce

You can download the Python notebooks used in the lecture from the link below. It is recommended that you keep executing the commands on your computer at pace with the lecture. You can also parallelly try experimenting with other commands that you may have in mind.
