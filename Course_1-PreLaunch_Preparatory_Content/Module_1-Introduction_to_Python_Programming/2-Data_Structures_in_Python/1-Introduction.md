# Introduction

Welcome to the second session on '**Data Structures in Python**'

In the previous session, you learnt the basics of Python and the most common data types used in Python. In this session, we will extend our discussion to the essential data structures frequently used in data analysis.

**VIDEO**

In this session, we will go into the depths of data structures - basically, structures that can hold the data together. A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. We will cover the four builtin data structures in Python i.e., **tuples**, **lists**, **dictionaries**, and **sets**, in a fair amount of depth. You will get ample opportunity to practice the exercises shared. Please space your learning throughout the week and try to go through the content multiple times before attempting the exercises.

You can open the link below to download the Python notebooks used in this session. We recommend that you keep executing the commands on your computer in pace with the lecture. You can parallelly try experimenting with other commands you may have in mind.

## Guidelines for in-module questions

The in-video and in-content questions for this module are **not graded**.
