# Summary

Congrats on completing your second session, hope you had fun creating the data containers for various use-cases, let's summarise what you learnt in this session:

**VIDEO**

To conclude, in this session we first had a look at various data structures supported by Python which are tuples, list, sets and dictionaries and then we understood the use-case or say features each one of these data structures offer. Hope this was an insightful sessions wherein we saw certain real-world application based use-cases and various operations supported by these data structures.

In the next session, we will dive deep into control structures and functions where you will learn about programming the <u>decision-making capabilities</u> and <u>automating tasks</u> via several *constructs* and *loops* supported by python.
