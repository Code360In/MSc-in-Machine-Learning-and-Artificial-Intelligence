# Practice Questions

By now you are well versed with the concepts of basic python programming. Given below are some practice questions. Download the jupyter notebook given below and solve these questions before moving on to the practice exercise:

Once you are done solving the questions, refer to the solution notebook below to find the correct answers:

Now let us test our newly acquired python skills on some practice questions (**un-graded**)

The following Python file consists of certain questions based on the concepts you have learnt in this session. You are expected to code in the jupyter notebook to find the correct solutions to the given questions and answer the below given MCQs.

For your reference Strings' commands and their input parameters are listed on this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp)

Based on your answers obtained in the notebook, attempt the following quiz.



#### Long Strings

Qn: Calculate the number of characters in the string.

- 193

- 200

- 300

- 500

Ans: A. `len(string)`

*Using the len() function, you can find the length of the string or in other words number of characters in the string*

#### 

#### 'a' minor String

Qn: Count the number of occurrences of 'a' in the string.

- 1

- 2

- 10

- 5

Ans: B. *We need to find the number of times 'a' has occurred in the string.  A very simple method to do that is*

`string.count('a')`

#### 

#### If Only

Qn: Identify whether the string starts with 'if'.

- False

- True

Ans: A. *It is asking whether the string is starting with if or not so it will return a boolean value*

`string.startswith('if')`



#### No Strings Attached

Qn: Return the substring starting at index 63 and ending at index 88 [Both the indexes are inclusive].

- 'OQYWFClFhFGA'

- 'mCfgDYqbaBHAUvIWhMnvwZnEMV'

- 'IWYwGKpmZhnJiyzTslSIhSwv'

- 'JMEphzmifTkyqOMNpnOtXZ'

Ans: B. `string[63:89]`

*Since both the starting and ending indexes are inclusive.*



#### 46th Character

Qn: Identify the 46th character in the string.

- a

- b

- z

- x

Ans: C. `string[45]`
