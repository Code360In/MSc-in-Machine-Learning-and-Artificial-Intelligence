# Summary

Let's summarise what you have learned in this session.

**VIDEO**

Summary from the video -

First, we started exploring the very basics of Python and then moved on and wrote our first Python program. Further which we saw the different data types supported by Python and the various arithmetic and string operations; finally, we attempted the coding questions based on a practice exercise.

In the next session, you will have a look at data structures that could store multiple values together.

Data structures are typically data containers that could store numerous values together - your driving license details, which might include numeric, text, or alphanumeric values, can be stored in a single data structure.

Up next, we will dive deep into various data structures supported by Python and learn about each one of them in detail.
