# Introduction

Welcome to the module on 'Introduction to Python'!

## In this module

You will get familiarize in working with the basic syntax of Python and introduced to certain programming basics of Python language. Let's hear from our subject matter expert, Behzad.

**VIDEO**

The first module includes four sessions:

- **Basics of Python**: This session introduces you to Python Programming and the environment you require for coding. Once you have the basic setup ready, you will learn to write your first program in Python, followed by learning about different data types. Finally, towards the end of the session, you will look at various arithmetic and string operations supported by Python. 

- **Data Structures in Python**: The session starts with Introducing various data structures in Python, which include tuples, lists, sets and dictionary. Further, you learn about all these data structures in detail and various operations related to them.

- **Control Structure and Functions in Python**: This session is the essence of programming since they help computers do what they do best — automate repetitive tasks intelligently. It incorporates all the decision making control structures and functions supported by Python. 

- **OOP in Python**: This session will teach you about the various object-oriented programming methodologies in Python that includes classes, objects and methods. 

## In this session

**VIDEO**

In this first session, we will start with the reasons behind using Python as the language of choice for Data Science. Then, in order to understand how to design and code programs, you need to understand the types of data that you want to work with and how to manipulate these data types. To understand this, you will go into the details of the different data types and the operations possible on each data type. This will be followed by a series of practice exercises to make the concepts clear. Please ensure that you go through the content multiple times before attempting the practice questions, especially if you are new to programming. 

**How to learn a new programming language, especially if you are new to programming?**

In case you are new to programming, please go through the videos multiple times to make sense of what is being discussed. Programming is essentially a different way of thinking. Just like driving, it may feel challenging initially, but once you get the hang of it, it almost becomes second nature. 

Please ensure that you do not go through the content in one go. You need to set up dedicated time daily throughout the week to learn and review. Trust us; if you do this, you will surprise yourself with how much you learn and retain through each week. 

Unlike other fields, the only way to learn programming is by practice - please feel free to make as many mistakes as you want when trying different programming tasks. It’s very rare that we get the program right the first time we write it. Expect to make mistakes but learn from them. Things will slowly start making sense.  
   
We hope you enjoy the process of learning with us.
