# Approaches for Generating Probability

Now, let’s understand the different approaches that can be used to determine the likelihood of an event. In this segment, you will learn about the following three approaches of probability:

- **Equal likelihood approach**

- **Relative frequency approach**

- **Judgemental approach**

In this video, you learnt about the following three approaches of probability that can be used to determine the likelihood of an event:

- **The equal likelihood approach**
  
  - If an experiment has n simple outcomes, then this method will assign a probability of 1/n to each outcome.
  
  - For example, 1/6 is the probability that the upper surface of an ordinary die will display six pips when it is rolled, considering it is equally likely that each of the six surfaces of the die will be displayed.  

- **The relative frequency approach**
  
  - In this method, probabilities are assigned based on previous experiments or historical trends.
  
  - For example,  life insurance companies will consider providing insurance to a young person over an old person. This is because intuition and numerous studies suggest that the likelihood of the survival of a young person is higher than that of an old person.  

- **The judgemental approach**
  
  - Sometimes, the aforementioned approaches might not necessarily be effective or too many factors might be involved in understanding the likelihood of an event. In such cases, you will have to rely on your own judgement in drawing a conclusion.
  
  - For example, before launching the world’s first electric vehicle, Tesla had no way of predicting whether it will be a success or a failure. The company had to rely on their intelligent judgements about the market and the product.  

You also learnt that the three approaches are not mutually exclusive, i.e., you may have to use any two or all three methods to determine the likelihood of an event.
