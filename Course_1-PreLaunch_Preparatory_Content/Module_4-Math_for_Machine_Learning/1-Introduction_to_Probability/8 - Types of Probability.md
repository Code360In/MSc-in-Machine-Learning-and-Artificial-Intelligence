# Types of Probability

Now that you have a basic understanding of what probability is, in this segment, you will learn about the different types of probability. The three major types of probability are as follows:

- Marginal probability

- Joint probability

- Conditional probability

To understand the different types of probability, Ankit has considered the following sample of people and the fraction of them belonging to ‘Male’, ‘Female’,’Emplòyed’ or Unemployed’ as follows:

To understand the three types of probability, let’s consider a scenario in which there are two types of events: Event A and Event B.

**Event A: The person is a ‘Man’.**

**Event B: The person is ‘Employed’.**

**Joint probability**

- This is the probability of two or more events happening simultaneously.

- If A and B are two events, then the joint probability of the two events is written as P(A ∩ B). Essentially, it is the probability of Event A and Event B occurring simultaneously.

- In the below example, the joint probability of these two events is the probability of a person being both a man and employed; hence, it is 0.1.

**Marginal probability**

- This is the probability of an event happening irrespective of the outcomes of another event also happening simultaneously.

- Considering the same example as above, suppose we want to find the probability of a person being employed, irrespective of whether the person is a man or woman.

- Since this probability is independent of the gender, this probability is a marginal probability

- As shown in the table given below, this marginal probability is 0.55.

**Conditional probability**

- This is the probability of an event happening given that another event has already occurred.

-  If A and B are two events, then the conditional probability of Event A occurring, given that Event B has occurred, is written as P(A|B).

- The general multiplication rule links the three types of probability in the following manner:

- If A = Person being male and B = Person being Unemployed, then the probability of a person being unemployed given that he is a male = 0.25 / 0.35 = 0.714

Let’s solve a question to test your understanding of the different types of probability. It is recommended that you first try to solve the question by yourself and then watch the video.

## Solved Example

A survey was conducted in a school to understand the sports preferences among boys and girls. The results derived from the survey are given in the image below.

Now, based on the given data:

1. Create a joint probability table.

2. Use marginal probability to determine the most preferred sport.

3. Find the probability that the student prefers football, given that the student is a boy.

4. Let A denote the event that the student is a boy and B denote the event that the student prefers football. Find whether A and B are independent or not.
