# Combinations

The second important counting principle that you need to be aware of is the method of using **combinations**. In the case of counting using the method of permutations, you had considered the 'order' to be an essential factor. Now, in the case of combinations, you need not take that into account while finding the number of ways to arrange a group of objects. Let's listen to the following lecture as Amit explains the concept.

**VIDEO**

hen you just have to choose some objects from a larger set and the **order is of no significance**, then the rule of counting that you use is called **combination**. In the example mentioned in the video, you had to choose three bowlers from a set of four bowlers and obviously, you didn't need to order them here. Some other examples of combinations are as follows:

- The number of ways in which you can pick three letters from the word 'UPGRAD',
- The number of ways a team can win three matches in a league of five matches,
- The number of ways in which you can select 13 cards from a deck of 52 cards,
- And so on.

The formula for counting the number of ways to choose r objects out of a set of n objects is

```math
nCr=n!r!(nâˆ’r)!
```

Now you might be wondering when to use permutations and when to use combinations. As mentioned in the video, one way to look at it is to see if the order matters or not. If it does, then use the permutations formula, and if doesn't, then use the one for combinations.

**Note**: A helpful hint here would be to look for a **keyword** in the given scenario to know which method is needed. If the problem requires you to **order/arrange** a group of objects, then you would most probably use the method of permutations. Else, if you are told to **pick/choose** a group of objects, then more often than not you would be using the formula for combinations.

There are some other rules of counting as well. For example, recall that in the permutation case, we had assumed that no repetition was allowed in the order and, hence, we proceeded with the given formula. Now, what to do if repetition is allowed in the process of counting the number of ways?

You'll get to know those types of examples in future sessions, and will also learn how to find the answer in such cases. For the time being, you need to know only these two methods, i.e., permutation and combination.

Now answer the following questions.

#### Combinations

Qn: Suppose you have a list of 10 customers who have given a bad rating to your product. Now you need to randomly pick three customers so that you can interview them and take their feedback. In how many ways can you choose three customers from the given set of 10?

You can use the Combination calculator from [here](https://stattrek.com/online-calculator/combinations-permutations.aspx).

- 160

- 720

- 120

- 240

Ans: C. *You have the formula for combinations, which is`n!/(r! (n-r)!)`. In the given problem, n = 10 and r = 3.  Substituting the value in the formula, you get `(10)!/3! 7! = 120`.*

Now that you've learnt the 2 fundamental counting rules, we'll go ahead and finally learn the basic definition of Probability and its associated properties.
