# Introduction to Linear Algebra

Welcome to the module on **Mathematics for Machine Learning**!

## **Why Linear Algebra?**

**Linear Algebra** is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of 'linear systems', vectors and matrices. If you do not know what linear algebra is, we highly recommend reading [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) quickly before moving ahead[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)

Why is linear algebra important for a data science professional? Broadly, it has the following two main uses:

### **1. Learning to Visualise Data**

The ability to **visualise data** is one of the most useful skills to possess as a data science professional, and a solid foundation in linear algebra enables you to do that. In fact, some concepts and algorithms are quite easy to understand if you visualise them as vectors and matrices etc., rather than looking at the data as lists and arrays of numbers.

### 2. Linear Algebra is the workhorse of Data Science and ML**

When you 'train a machine learning model' using a library (such as in R or Python), much of what happens behind the scenes is a bunch of matrix operations. The most popular deep learning library today, [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), is essentially an optimised (i.e. fast and reliable) matrix-manipulation library. So is [scikit-learn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scikit-learn), the Python library for machine learning. You will learn to use these libraries in this program.

Although you would usually use these libraries directly (without bothering about what they do behind the curtains), you may ocassionally need to **write your own algorithms** from scratch. To do that, you will need to write code using vectors and matrices.

## **What to Expect**

If your level of understanding of linear algebra is **basic**, this module will help you brush up the concepts and will give you the opportunity of implementing the concepts as Numpy code.

If your level of understanding of linear algebra is **advanced**, some of the initial concepts may seem too easy, but the latter ones might be worth looking at (sessions 3 and 4).

## **Video Content**

Since this is an optional module, the video content present in it has been **curated** from some acclaimed YouTube videos. We have tried to find good learning resources and have included their links in the module. Prominent among them are the YouTube channels of **Khan Academy** and **3Blue1Brown**.

## **Coding Boxes and Questions**

During this module, we will demonstrate certain concepts through Numpy code. You will come across (ungraded) questions where you will have to **write basic Numpy code** - these are meant to teach you how to implement concepts in Numpy.

## **Main Areas of Study**

Following are the main areas that you will study within this module:

- Vectors & Vector Spaces
- Matrices
- Linear Transformations

## **Graded Question Guidelines**

There are **no graded questions** in this module.
