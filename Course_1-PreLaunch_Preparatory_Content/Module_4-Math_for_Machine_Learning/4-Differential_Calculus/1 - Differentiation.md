Differentiation

In this segment, let's revisit some concepts and formulae of derivatives.

## **Differentiation**

Differentiation is the action of computing a derivative. The derivative of a function y=f(x) is a measure of the rate at which the value y of the function changes with respect to the change in the variable x. It is called the derivative of f with respect to x.
Although in practice, we usually compute derivatives using 'rules' ![](https://i.ibb.co/LkQkGNQ/Diff-1.png) it is worth recalling how these rules are arrived at, and more importantly, what they mean.

To get a basic understanding of derivatives, watch this video on the [first principles of derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay8838UZ4nM&index=18&list=PL19E79A0638C8D449) by Khan Academy.

To get a visual understanding of limits, you can **optionally** [watch this video on limits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfF40MiS7zA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=7) by 3Blue1Brown. We have summarized the concepts from these two videos in the section below. ![](https://i.ibb.co/68cfZ4Y/Diff-2.png) Let's consider an example f(x)=x2 and calculate it's derivative at x=4: ![](https://i.ibb.co/6B7dQ36/Diff-3.png)The above method is also referred to as **derivatives by first principles**. This method is the foundation for the rest of differential calculus: every differentiation rule and identity in calculus is based on the concept of derivatives by first principles.

#### Derivatives by First Principles

Qn: Differentiate the following function f(x)=x3+x2/2+3 and evaluate the differential at x=5. You may already know how to compute the derivative directly, but you may try doing it using first principles for a short algebra warm-up.  
Ans: 80

Qn: Differentiate the function f(x)=x2−5x+6 and evaluate the differential at x=−1 using first principles.  
Ans: -7

In practice, computing derivatives by first principles is a tedious process. But once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other complex functions can be easily computed using some rules_._

## **Differentiation Rules for Common Functions**

In the following section, we have summarised the differentiation rules for common functions. You can quickly skim through these.

To get a basic understanding of differentiation using the chain rule, watch this video on [Chain rule | Derivative rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0QrHO56qg) by Khan Academy. You can **optionally** watch this video on [Visualizing the chain rule and product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG15m2VwSjA) [rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG15m2VwSjA) by 3Blue1Brown.

The following example illustrates some of these rules in action:
