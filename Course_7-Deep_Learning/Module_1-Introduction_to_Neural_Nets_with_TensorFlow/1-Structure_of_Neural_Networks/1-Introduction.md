# Introduction

Welcome to the course on **Deep Learning**. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that tries to mimic the functioning of the human brain while dealing with data. It is also referred to as the Artificial Neural Network.

## In this module

You will learn what are arguably the most sophisticated and cutting-edge models in machine learning - Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Inspired by the structure of the human brain, neural networks have established a reputation for successfully learning complex tasks such as object recognition in images, machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and image captioning.

Let’s watch the next video where Rohit will walk you through the topics you are going to learn in this module.

In this module, you will learn about the basic structure of neural networks, i.e, the artificial neurons. You will learn about the inputs and outputs to these networks, activation functions associated with the neurons, and assumptions that help in simplifying the entire process. You will also learn how the information flows from one layer to the next in a forward manner, and how to calculate the predicted output of the model. Once you have the predicted output, you will understand how to make the process more efficient using the loss function and backpropagation.

After being well equipped with the knowledge of neural networks, you will be able to build your own neural network from scratch in NumPy and TensorFlow. Finally, you will be going through different hyperparameter tuning techniques to improve the results of the neural networks. 

## In this session

You will learn about the structure of neural networks. Let’s hear more about it from Rohit in the upcoming video.

You will begin this session by learning about the limitations of previous machine learning models and how ANNs can overcome some of them. After this, you will deep dive into the concepts of ANNs and their inspiration from the human brain. You will start learning about ANNs by understanding the very first neural network model, i.e., perceptrons, and how they can be used for classification problems.

Next, you will see how the artificial neural networks evolved from the basic perceptrons. You will be learning about the basic building blocks of ANNs, i.e., artificial neurons, and how they together build a neural network. The session will also help you in understanding the following elements:

-   Inputs and outputs of a neural network
    
-   Activation function for a neuron
    
-   Structure and topology of the entire neural network

These elements will form the parameters and the hyperparameters of the network. Lastly, you will also learn some simplifying assumptions which will make working with ANNs much easier.

This session will form your base for the upcoming sessions. It mainly focuses on the theoretical explanation of ANNs, but it is essential to have a clear understanding of the concepts here for ease in the future.
