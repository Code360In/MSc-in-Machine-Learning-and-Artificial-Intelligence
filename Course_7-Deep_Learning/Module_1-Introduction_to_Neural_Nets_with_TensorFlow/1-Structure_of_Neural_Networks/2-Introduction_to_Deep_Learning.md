# Introduction to Deep Learning

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning (ML) and usually deals with unsupervised data such as images, videos, text, and speech data. In the past few years, deep artificial neural networks have proven to perform surprisingly well on complex tasks such as speech recognition (converting speech to text), machine translation, image, and video classification, etc. Such models are also commonly called **deep learning models.** 

Deep learning is gaining increasing popularity in recent years due to its wide range of applications. Let’s hear about them in the upcoming video.

You might have noticed that many of these applications are used in your day-to-day life. The most common of these applications is face recognition to unlock your devices or voice assistants such as Siri, Google Voice Assistant, and Alexa. 

After knowing about these extensive applications, you can understand why deep learning is in great demand. Deep learning makes remarkably complex things possible, such as sentiment analysis and self-driving cars. However, before you proceed ahead, it is important for you to understand why you do not use preliminary machine learning models for these applications. What is it that the deep learning models are able to learn from this data but preliminary ML models such as regression are not able to? Rohit will talk about this in detail in the next video.

Note: In the above video, classical machine learning refers to the preliminary machine learning models such as regression models and decision trees which you have learnt previously.

The above video helped you in differentiating between the preliminary ML algorithms and deep learning algorithms. Let us quickly go through the same:

1.  The performance of deep learning models increases with the increase in data available; however, with preliminary machine learning algorithms, this is not true. As the volume of data increases, the deep learning models tend to outperform the preliminary ML models.
   
2.  Machine learning models such as regression require a large number of assumptions to build models as compared with deep learning models.  
   
3.  Machine learning algorithms like regression usually require structured data, whereas deep learning networks can be applied to both structured and unstructured data.  
   
4.  Additionally, preliminary machine learning algorithms require a lot of human intervention in terms of time required in feature engineering, whereas, in deep learning, the nested layers allow the data to learn from their errors.

Now that you have an understanding of why you need deep learning algorithms, let’s get started with the introduction to deep learning. Let’s understand deep learning from Rohit in the next video.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is further a subset of artificial intelligence as shown in the image given below.

Similar to machine learning, deep learning has multiple algorithms to deal with different types of data and problems. The ‘deep’ in deep learning signifies the depth of the neural network that enables the network to approximate the feature representations by passing through multiple layers and learning from its errors.

**Note**: The term ‘deep learning’ and artificial neural networks are used interchangeably throughout the module.

In the next segment, you will learn how artificial neural networks came into existence and their inspiration.
