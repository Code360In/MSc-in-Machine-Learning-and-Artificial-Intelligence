# Summary

In the next video, let’s take a quick look at what you have learnt in this session.

**VIDEO**

In this session, you learnt the following:

1.  Firstly, you understood the limitations of preliminary machine learning and how deep learning can be used to build complex models.  
     
2.  Next, you saw how the architecture of ANNs draws inspiration from the human brain.  
     
3.  You also learnt how the perceptron acts as a binary classifier and can perform complex classification tasks.  
    
4.  You learnt about the basic building block of ANNs: Neurons. The structure of an artificial neuron is shown below:

    Where, ‘a’ represents the inputs, ‘w’ represents the weights associated with the inputs and ‘b’ represents the bias of the neuron.  
     
5.  You then understood the architecture of ANNs - the topology, the parameters (weights and biases) on which the neural network is trained, the hyperparameters, etc.  
     
6.  You also learnt that ANNs only take numerical inputs; hence, you need to convert all types of data to a numeric format so that neural networks can process it.  
     
7.  Then, you were introduced to the most common activation functions such as sigmoid, ReLU and hyperbolic tangent function as shown below

8.  Next, you saw some simplifying assumptions in the architecture.  
     
9.  Finally, you fixed the following notations that you would use in future segments and modules:
    
    1.  _W_ is for weight matrix
        
    2.  _b_ stands for the bias
        
    3.  _x_ stands for input
        
    4.  _y_ is the ground truth label
        
    5.  _p_ is the probability vector of the predicted output
        
    6.  _h_ is the output of the hidden layers
        
    7.  The superscript stands for layer number
        
    8.  The subscript stands for the index of the individual neuron

In the next segment, you will attempt the graded questions to test your learning. All the best!
