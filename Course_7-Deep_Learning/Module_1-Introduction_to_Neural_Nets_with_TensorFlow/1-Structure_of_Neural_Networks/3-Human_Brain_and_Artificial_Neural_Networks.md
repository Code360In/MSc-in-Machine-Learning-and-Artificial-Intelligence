# Human Brain and Artificial Neural Networks

As the name suggests, the design of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is inspired by the human brain. Although not as powerful as the brain yet, artificial neural networks are the most powerful learning models in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In the past few years, deep artificial neural networks have proven to perform surprisingly well on complex tasks such as speech recognition (converting speech to text), machine translation, and image and video classification. Such models are also commonly called deep learning models.

Artificial neural networks are said to be inspired by the structure of the brain. The brain consists of billions of neurons. The basic structure of a biological neuron is shown in the image below:

Let us hear from Rohit about how ANNs are inspired by the human brain in the upcoming video.

To summarise, Artificial Neural Networks are a collection of a large number of simple devices called **artificial neurons** as shown in the image provided below.

A large number of these artificial neurons working together form the artificial neural network. This network ‘learns’ to conduct certain tasks, such as recognizing a cat, by training the neurons to ‘fire’ in a certain way when given a particular input, such as a cat. In other words, the network inhibits or amplifies the input signals to implement a certain task, such as recognizing a cat, speaking a word, or identifying a tree.

The image provided below provides an understanding of how different parts of an artificial neuron correspond to those of a biological neuron.

A biological neuron receives information (inputs) from multiple neurons. These inputs are received in the dendrites of the neuron that are then processed in the axon (cell body) and output is computed. This output is then transmitted to the other neurons through the synapse. 

Similarly, an artificial neuron receives information from multiple neurons with weights associated with them; the weighted inputs are then inhibited or amplified as they pass through the body of the artificial neuron. The output thus computed is passed on to the next neuron.

Now that you have understood how artificial neural networks are inspired by the human brain, let's understand how they differ from each other. Let’s take a look at the basic differences mentioned below:

1.  While the brain consists of billions of biological neurons, ANNs can consist of neurons ranging from 10 to 1000s of them. There is no restriction on the number of neurons that an ANN can have but as the number of neurons increases, the complexity of the model also increases. Therefore, they are generally limited up to thousands in a network.  
     
    
2.  The connections between the biological neurons are asynchronous and not arranged in any specific pattern, whereas artificial neurons are arranged in an organized manner in the form of layers.  
     
    
3.  The speed of functioning in the human brain depends on how fast impulses travel from one neuron to another which cannot be controlled manually. However, in the case of ANNs, you can control the speed of functioning as the neurons do not get tired.
    

So far, you have seen how ANNs were inspired. In the next segment, you will learn about the perceptron. The perceptron was one of the earliest proposed neural networks for learning simple classification tasks that later on became the fundamental building block of artificial neural networks. Let’s explore them in the next segment.
