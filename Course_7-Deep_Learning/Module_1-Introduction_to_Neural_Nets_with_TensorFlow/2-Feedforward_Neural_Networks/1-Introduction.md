# Introduction

Welcome to the second session of this session **‘Feedforward Neural Networks’**. 

In the previous session, you learnt about the basic building blocks of a neural network, i.e., artificial neurons and their inspiration from the brain. You also learnt about the various specifications of a neural network as well as its parameters, hyperparameters and various simplifying assumptions.  
 

## In this session

You will learn how information flows in a neural network from the input layer to the output layer. The flow of information in this direction is often called feedforward. In the next video, our faculty, Usha, will discuss the various topics that will be covered in this session.

**VIDEO**

In the above video, you were introduced to the topics that you will be learning in this session. Let us take a look at them:

1.  Information flow between the layers of the network
2.  Calculating the predicted output of the network
3.  Feedforward algorithm and pseudocode for this algorithm
4.  Vectorized approach to the feedforward algorithm
5.  Feedforward code implementation on NumPy using the MNIST data set

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this session other than knowledge of matrix multiplication and previous courses on Statistics and ML.

## People you will hear from in this session
