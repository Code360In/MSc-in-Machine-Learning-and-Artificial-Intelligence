# Introduction

In the previous session, you learnt how to mathematically derive the backpropagation algorithm and build a neural network on NumPy which was required you to define lengthy and complicated functions.

## In this session

You will learn about an ML library called **TensorFlow,** knowledge of which will help you build your own neural network with much ease. In the upcoming video, you will be provided with an overview of this session.

**VIDEO**

The objectives of this session include the following: 

1.  You will learn about the capabilities of TensorFlow as an ML library, which specialises in deep learning.
2.  You will get an understanding of the coding paradigm of TensorFlow to perform simple coding tasks.
3.  The session will focus on the fundamentals of TensorFlow, such as its data structure, tensors, and certain mathematical operations that can be performed using this ML library. 
4.  Finally, you will build your own neural network using the MNIST data set and the TensorFlow library.

During the session, there will be small coding challenges that you can attempt in order to become fluent with TensorFlow.

## People, you will hear from in this session
