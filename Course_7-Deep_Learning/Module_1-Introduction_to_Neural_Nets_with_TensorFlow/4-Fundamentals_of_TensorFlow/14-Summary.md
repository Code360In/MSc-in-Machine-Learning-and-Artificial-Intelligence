# Summary

In this session, you learnt many new concepts related to TensorFlow. You will hear about them in the forthcoming video.

**VIDEO**

So, here is a summary of the concepts that were covered by this session:

1.  First, you learn how to declare two types of tensors:
    1.  tf.constant
    2.  tf.Variable  
         
2.  Next, you learnt how to perform basic mathematical operations on these tensors using different functions.  
     
3.  After learning about these mathematical operations, you learnt how to perform linear algebra tasks using TensorFlow.  
     
4.  Matrix operations can be performed only if they have compatible shapes, which might not be the case every time. Hence, you learnt how to use reshaping and broadcasting to modify a shape to make it compatible.  
     
5.  You learnt how TensorFlow generates computational graphs for performing various operations.  
     
6.  You also learnt how the gradient is computed in TensorFlow which are you during model training in deep learning.  
     
7.  You also learnt how to minimise functions and saw the architecture of TensorFlow.   
     
8.  Finally, using all the knowledge, you built your own model on TensorFlow.
