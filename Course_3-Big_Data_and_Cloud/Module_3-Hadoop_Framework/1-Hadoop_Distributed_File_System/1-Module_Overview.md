# Module Overview

Welcome to this module on ‘**Hadoop Framework**’.

So far, in this program, you have got a basic understanding of machine learning and gained practical expertise in handling the AWS cloud platform. Before you start exploring the domain of machine learning, it is essential for you to understand the different ways to store and process massive amounts of data, also known as ‘**big data'**.

Due to the enormous size of big data, its storage and processing require different infrastructure when compared with the traditional systems, such as Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). Hadoop is a framework that is designed to provide the required infrastructure.

## In this module

Let’s start with a quick introduction video by industry expert Kautuk, who will explain the scope of the module.

As Kautuk mentioned, over the course of this module, you will understand the Hadoop framework, which is essential when dealing with big data. You will begin by understanding

- The storage layer, which is the **Hadoop Distributed File System.**
- Then, you will learn about the processing component - **MapReduce.**
- And the resource allocator component - **Yarn** of the Hadoop framework.

Towards the end of the module, you will be able to map the theoretical concepts that you learnt in the module to the practical implementation using the **[AWS service EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/)** which is a platform for processing and analyzing big data.

## In this session

You will learn about the following topics:

- Understanding distributed systems

- CAP Theorem

- Introduction to HDFS

- Storage in HDFS

- HDFS architecture

- Replication and its Importance

- On-premise Hadoop cluster

- Cluster demonstration

- Read and write operations in HDFS
