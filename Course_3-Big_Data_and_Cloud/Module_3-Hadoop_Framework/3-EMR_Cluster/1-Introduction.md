# Introduction

Welcome to the session on ‘EMR Cluster’. 

In the previous sessions, you learnt about the Hadoop framework in detail. In the first session, you understood the storage layer, which is the **Hadoop Distributed File System**. Then, you learnt about processing and resource allocator components, i.e., **YARN** and **MapReduce**, in detail.  

In this session, you will learn about the **Amazon EMR cluster**, which is a managed cluster with the Hadoop framework running in the background. You will first understand its advantages over an on-premise cluster and learn how to launch an EMR cluster using the AWS console. Then, you will learn some basic HDFS operations, such as creating a folder, moving data from the local file system to HDFS. Furthermore, you will learn how to run a MapReduce job on EMR and store the results generated on S3. Finally, you will learn how to terminate the cluster and also clone back the terminated cluster in case you need it in the future.
