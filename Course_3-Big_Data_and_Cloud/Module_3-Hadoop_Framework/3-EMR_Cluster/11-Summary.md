# Summary

Let’s quickly summarise what you have learnt so far in the video below.

**VIDEO**

In this session, you started by understanding the concept of an EMR cluster; you learnt about some of its advantages over an on-premise cluster. Then, you saw how to launch an EMR cluster and also did a secure shell login for connecting to the cluster. On connecting to the cluster, you did some basic HDFS operations, such as creating a folder and moving data from the local file system to HDFS. You also learnt how to run a MapReduce job on EMR and store the results generated on S3. Finally, you learnt how to terminate the cluster and also clone back the terminated cluster in case you need it in the future.
