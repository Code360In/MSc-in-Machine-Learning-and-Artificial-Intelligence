# Advantages of AWS over On-Premise Hardware

Earlier, the professor demonstrated the concepts using an on-premise cluster with the Hadoop framework running on those machines. Setting up an on-premise cluster is very difficult and also maintaining it has its own challenges. Amazon makes this entire process of setting up the cluster easy and hassle-free. In the next video, you will look at the advantages of moving from an on-premise cluster to an AWS managed service.

The advantages of AWS managed service over an on-premise cluster are as follows:Â 

1.  **Cost**: Setting up an on-premise cluster involves a huge investment in the hardware, but in the case of the Cloud, it is **pay as you go**. In other words, you do not buy any hardware; you rent the necessary hardware from the Cloud and pay as per your usage.
2.  **Services**: While handling any big data task, you may require a lot of services based on the business use case. In an on-premise cluster, installing these services and managing the software is tricky, but this is not the case with the Cloud; here, AWS manages all of that for you.
3.  **Quick upgrades**: All the services associated would have frequent updates and improvements. To reflect these upgrades on your on-premise cluster, you need to update your entire infrastructure, but in the case of a Cloud cluster, you can choose the updated version of services and launch a new cluster.
4.  **Quick prototyping (Environment)**: To do some quick prototypes, you may need to make changes to your existing environment. For this, you need to have a similar test cluster where you can experiment, but in the case of an on-premise cluster, this would require additional resources and go through the hassle of setting up the cluster. This can be handled by cloning an existing cluster in the case of Cloud services.
5.  **Security**: Network intrusions are a common phenomenon when handling a distributed system. In the case of cloud services, these are handled by the Cloud provider.
