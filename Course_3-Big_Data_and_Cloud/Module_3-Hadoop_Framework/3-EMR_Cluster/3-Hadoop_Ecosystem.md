# Hadoop Ecosystem

In the last segment, you learnt the advantages of using the Cloud (AWS) over an on-premise Hadoop cluster. During this discussion, you understood that there are a lot of services built on top of Hadoop. In this segment, let’s look at some of these services.

Some commonly used components of the Hadoop stack are:

1.  **Sqoop**: This is an application that provides a command-line interface for transferring data between Hadoop and relational databases.
2.  **Flume**: This is a distributed, reliable and available service for efficiently collecting, aggregating and moving large amounts of streaming event data. It is also used for ingesting massive quantities of event data, such as network traffic data, social-media-generated data and data from email messages. 
3.  **Oozie and Airflow**: These are workflow scheduler systems for Hadoop, providing control over complex multi-stage Hadoop jobs.
4.  **Hive and Presto**: These are data warehouses that provide SQL-like interfaces to query databases and file systems integrated with Hadoop.
5.  **Pig**: This is a high-level language for writing programs that run on Apache Hadoop. It allows the creation of user-defined functions, thereby making programming much simpler than writing MapReduce codes.
6.  **HBase**: This is a column-based NoSQL database that provides high throughput and low latency on Hadoop platforms. It provides a fault-tolerant method to store large quantities of sparse data and perform real-time analytics.
7.  **Spark**: This is a fast and general computer engine for Hadoop data. It provides a simple and expressive programming model to support machine learning.

In this segment, you got an understanding of the list of services in the Hadoop Ecosystem. As you move along the program, you may use some of these services based on specific industry problems.
