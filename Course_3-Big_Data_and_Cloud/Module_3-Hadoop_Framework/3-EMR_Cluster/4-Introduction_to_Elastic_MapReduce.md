# Introduction to Elastic MapReduce

Now that you have got a fair understanding of the list of services available as part of the Hadoop Ecosystem, in the next video, let’s start exploring Elastic MapReduce, which is a managed Hadoop cluster by AWS. 

**VIDEO**

In this video, you learnt that: 

1.  EMR is a managed service provided by AWS built on top of Hadoop. It is referred to as a managed service because unlike an on-premise cluster, you do not have to manually install Hadoop and do the necessary configuration, as AWS manages all of that for you. 
2.  All the services such as Spark for running big data processing jobs, Oozie to schedule those jobs, Presto or Hive to query the HDFS data using SQL and a lot more can be installed on the same EMR cluster just by selecting the list of services that you need at the time of installation. 
3.  EMR enables on-demand utilisation of resources. In other words, you can simply terminate the cluster if you no longer require it and simply clone it back whenever you require it in the future.
4.  EMR gives you an additional benefit of using all the other AWS services, as they are tightly integrated with each other. For example, instead of storing your HDFS in a disk, you can leverage S3, and EMR will still work just fine.
