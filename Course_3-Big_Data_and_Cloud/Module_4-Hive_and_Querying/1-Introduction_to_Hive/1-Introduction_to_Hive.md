# Introduction to Hive

Welcome to the practical module on Hive in the domain of Big Data.

You learnt about HDFS and MapReduce in the previous modules. The HDFS is just a storage system to store multiple files of various file formats. MapReduce works on top of the HDFS to retrieve data from it.

The previous course also covered RDBMS and SQL querying where you learnt about the various features of RDBMS and understood how to query into databases using SQL. You can revisit it [here](https://learn.upgrad.com/course/1853/segment/13565/86167/257671/1343697). As part of this module, you will learn another tool, **Apache Hive**, which is used to write queries for Big Data.

## In this module

You will learn about the architecture and features of Hive. You will also learn how to write queries to derive useful insights from the data available in the HDFS. Further, you will get an understanding of various query optimisation techniques to get faster results.

So, let’s begin the module and learn how Hive came into the picture, along with a recap of what you have learnt in the previous modules.

Suppose you are working as an analyst at an e-commerce company. You have a good understanding of data analysis and machine learning concepts, but do not have a strong programming background or know much about JAVA, C# or a high-level programming language.

Without any understanding of such programming languages, you cannot query the HDFS using MapReduce. However, as an analyst, your job is to derive useful insights from data sets by building machine learning models and performing EDA on them, rather than doing hardcore programming to retrieve data from the HDFS.

Hence, Hive came into the picture to rescue you from doing unnecessary programming to query into the HDFS with MapReduce. It contains an SQL-like language and other architectural features called **Hive Query Language (HiveQL)**, which makes it very easy to query into the HDFS.

In this module, you will learn about Hive and understand how to query into the HDFS using Hive Query Language. Following is an overview of what this module will cover:

- What is Hive?

- Features of Hive

- Hive Architecture

- A comparative analysis of RDBMS and Hive

- Basic Hive queries:

  - Creation of database and tables

  - Types of tables: Internal & External tables.

  - Complex data types

  - Ordering

  - Indexing

- Advanced Hive queries:

  - Partitioning

  - Bucketing

  - Joins

## In this session

You will learn about the following concepts:

- What Hive is and what it is not

- OLTP vs OLAP

- Salient features of Hive

- Use cases of Hive

- The basic architecture of Hive

- A comparative analysis of Hive and RDBMS
