# Use Cases of Hive

So far, you have learnt what Hive is and what its features are.  Now, Let’s look at the use cases of Hive from Vishwa based on his experience.

In the next video, you will learn about the several use-cases on Hive.

As explained in the video, there are several use cases of hive and is widely used in many companies across different industries. Some of them are as follows.

- **Reporting**: Let’s consider a mutual fund company, where the average, minimum or maximum price of the stocks needs to be calculated at the end of each day. This process is called reporting, where you need to run scheduled reports in a particular period of time.  
     The other use case of Hive under-reporting is as follows: Often, you need to perform analytics on data to derive useful insights and present them to the higher management to facilitate their decision-making.

- **Ad-hoc analysis**: Let’s take the aforementioned example again, except this time, you are not supposed to present the report of the stock price at the end of each day. Instead, you want to see the current price of the group of shares and predict the price of the stocks after one hour, based on the fall or rise in the share price. This is called an ad hoc analysis, where you query into the database for a particular ad-hoc demand.

- **Machine learning**: As you already know, Hive is an OLAP system, where you conduct data analysis and build ML algorithms to derive useful insights from it.

The image below mentions some of the applications.

Use cases of Hive hive :

- **Text mining** — Unstructured data with a convenient structure overlaid and analyzed with map-reduce
- **Document indexing** — Assigning tags to multiple documents for easier recovery
- **Business queries** — Querying larger volumes of historic data to get actionable insights, e.g. transaction history, payment history, customer database, etc.
- **Log processing** — Processing various types of log files like call logs, weblogs, machine logs, etc.

Following are some of the companies that are using Hive these days:

- Facebook

- Bizo

- Chitika

- CNet

- Walmart
