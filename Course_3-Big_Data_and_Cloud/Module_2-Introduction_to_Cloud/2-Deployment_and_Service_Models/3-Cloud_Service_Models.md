# Cloud Service Models

The services offered by cloud service providers are classified into three categories, namely,
**IaaS**, **PaaS** and **SaaS**. Let’s watch the upcoming videos where you will explore each of them in detail.

**VIDEO**

So, as you’ve just learnt, the IaaS allows customers to access the cloud infrastructure resources, such as networking features, data storage space and virtualised servers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), from a cloud service provider. It is an on-demand service. It offers users the highest level of flexibility and management control over the resources.

Common examples of Iaas include

1. DigitalOcean
2. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
3. Cisco Metapod
4. Microsoft Azure
5. Google Compute Engine (GCE)

In the video, you also learnt about the three different types of IaaS, which are as follows:

1. Virtual machines on a shared physical server

2. Virtual machines on a dedicated physical server

3. Dedicated bare-metal physical server

Here are some of the advantages of Infrastructure as a Service:

1. The service provider provides the infrastructure, and the user has to just install an operating system of their requirements and work on it.

2. The user can modify the architecture as per their requirements since it is basic cloud infrastructure.

3. The user has full control over all the computing resources.

#### Quiz

Qn: Select whether the following statement is true or false.

Virtual machines on a dedicated physical server are more expensive than dedicated bare-metal physical servers.

- True

- False

Ans: B *This is the correct answer. Dedicated bare-metal physical servers are more expensive than virtual machines on a dedicated physical server. Now, think why dedicated bare-metal physical servers are more expensive and answer the next question

Qn: In IaaS, at what level in the data centre stack does the user get access? (Consider VM on shared or dedicated servers).

- Custom environment

- Virtualised server

- Server

- Application

Ans: B. *In the IaaS model, the service provider manages the networking, storage, servers and virtualisation, while the user would be responsible for the OS, middleware, runtime, data and applications.*

So far, you have learnt about one of the cloud service models, namely, IaaS. In the next segment, you will learn about the other two cloud service models, namely, PaaS and SaaS.
