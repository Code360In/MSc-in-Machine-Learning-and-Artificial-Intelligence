# Cloud Deployment Models

By now, you must have understood that to avail benefits like on-demand self-service, rapid elasticity, measured services, etc., users need to deploy their applications on the cloud. However, there are various deployment models for each application, and each of these models has its own set of benefits. So, let’s learn about them from Vinod in the next video.

**VIDEO**

So, as you learnt, the most popular cloud deployment model is a public cloud.

## Public Cloud

A public cloud platform offers services via a third party to all its users by allowing them to access the resources over the Internet. The cloud provider owns and manages all physical devices, such as servers, storage devices, etc., and provides access to the users. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of a public cloud:

**Advantages:**

1. It is highly scalable. It offers flexibility to either scale up or down the usage of resources as per the demand or based on a user’s request.

2. It is also cost-effective. Users of a public cloud have to pay for only what they use.

**Disadvantages:**

1. A public cloud might have security issues.

2. It is not 100% customisable as per an organisation’s requirements.

## Private Cloud

In a private cloud, the resources are provisioned to only an authorised user. Here the user can be an organisation with multiple consumers. Here, the user can own and manage the resources or a third party can manage for the user or any combination of them can be possible. It can exist on or off premises of the organisation. However, as discussed in the video, a private cloud is different from on-premises data centres. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of a private cloud:

**Advantages:**

1. It provides high security and also restricts access only to authorised users. Hence, this kind of infrastructure is generally preferred in financial institutions like banks, insurance firms, etc.

2. It provides high control over the resources.

**Disadvantages:**

1. It is not cost-effective when compared with a public cloud.

2. It has limited scalability and can be scaled only up to the internal hosted resources.

Now, let’s consider a scenario: Say, there is a community of organisations that wish to work on the common data privately, without letting such information be disclosed to organisations external to the community. Now, do they have to create multiple private clouds to meet this requirement? The answer is No. This is where the community cloud model comes into the picture. You will learn more about this in the upcoming video.

## Community Cloud

A community cloud platform offers services to a group of organisations to access the resources. Here, the setup, infrastructure, resources, etc are shared among a group of organisations that belong to the same community or geographical area. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of a community cloud:

**Advantages:**

1. The cost of maintenance can be shared among the organisations in the community.

2. It is more secure than a public cloud and less expensive than a private cloud.

**Disadvantages:**

1. It is difficult to distribute the responsibilities among the organisations in a community.

2. It is difficult to segregate the data among the organisations in a community.

## Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud is a combination of a public and a private cloud. For example, it could be a combination of private cloud storage with public services to create more value out of the cloud infrastructure. Also, it allows data and application sharing between these two cloud environments. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of a hybrid cloud:

**Advantages:**

1. A private cloud is secure, and hence, a hybrid cloud is secure as well.

2. Scalability: you already know that the public cloud is scalable. Therefore, the hybrid cloud which is the combination of public and private cloud is also scalable.

3. Users can access both the private and the public cloud as per their requirements; thus, a hybrid cloud offers flexibility.

4. Public cloud is cost-effective, hence hybrid cloud is also cost-effective if the user wants to use the public cloud properties.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Complex networking problems:** Due to the complexity of having the public and the private cloud, there would be an issue in configuring the network.

2. **Organisation’s security compliance:** Both the public and the private cloud should comply with the organisation’s security norms, and it is not easy to set up the clouds to meet this requirement.

So far in this segment, you have learnt about various cloud deployment models. Now, to deploy your applications on the cloud, you also need to know about the various cloud service providers. In the upcoming video, you will learn about some of the popular cloud service providers in the world today.

**VIDEO**

So, in the video, you learnt about three popular cloud service providers, namely, [Amazon Web Service](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/) and the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).

Now that you have learnt about the different cloud deployment models and popular cloud service providers, try and answer the following questions.

#### Quiz

Qn: Select all statements that are true:

- A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by one business or organisation.

- On-premises traditional data centres follow all the basic cloud characteristics.

- In a public cloud, the resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and are delivered over the Internet.

- A public cloud consists of computing resources that are entirely used exclusively by one business or organisation.

Ans: A & C.

- *In a private cloud, the resources are provisioned to only one authorized entity. The entity can be an organisation with multiple consumers or a single user. These resources can be managed by the entity, or a third party can do the same for them. Moreover, the infrastructure can exist within or off the premises of the organisation.*
- *A public cloud platform offers its services via a third party to all its users by allowing them to access the resources over the Internet. Here, the cloud provider owns and manages all the physical resources.*

Qn: Which of the following cloud deployment models offers greater flexibility for modifying the underlying hardware of the cloud resources?

- Public cloud

- Community cloud

- Private cloud

- Both 2 and 3

Ans: C. *In the private cloud model, the organisation either sets up its own cloud or gets it done by a third party. However, the organisation holds the rights to make any modifications to the underlying hardware.*

Qn: Let’s say you are working on a private cloud and are running out of capacity. In this situation, offloading less important applications from the private cloud to a public cloud to save cost is the application of the _________ cloud deployment model.

- Community

- Public

- Hybrid

- Private

Ans: C. *A hybrid cloud is a combination of a public and a private cloud. Here, both the private and the public cloud are used. Hence, it is an application of the hybrid cloud model.*

Now, the services offered by cloud service providers can be classified into various categories. You will learn about these in the next segment.
