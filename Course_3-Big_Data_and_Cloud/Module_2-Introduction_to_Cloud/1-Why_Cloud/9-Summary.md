# Summary

Hereâ€™s a summary of what you have learnt so far in this session:

1. First, you began with understanding the procedure followed before the cloud. Then you explored the issues faced with traditional data centres and learnt how cloud solved those issues. Then, you explored a few benefits of the cloud over traditional data centres.

2. After that, you understood the fundamental technology, i.e., virtualisation, which made cloud computing possible. You also learnt about the types of hypervisor.

   - Additional resources: There are different types of virtualisation as well. Please refer to **[this](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-virtualization)** link for more information.  

3. After that, you learnt about containerisation and also explored its architecture. Then you understood how containerisation is different from virtualisation.![Containers](https://i.ibb.co/jTBJjKq/Containers.png)

4. Later, you learnt about the essential characteristics of the cloud by exploring its various benefits. The essential characteristics of the cloud are:

   - Measured Services

   - Rapid Elasticity

   - Resource Pooling

   - Broad Network Access

   - On-Demand Self-Service
