# Introduction

Welcome to the second session on **‘AWS Services’**.

You are now equipped to perform the necessary tasks associated with the essential services through the Management Console and the CLI. We will now explore some new services from the large pool of services that AWS offers on its platform.

## In this session

You will learn how to use a monitoring service along with the machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) services that AWS offers on its platform.

- The ML/AI services are pre-trained solutions that can be applied to your files via the web platform. They can also be used as part of different applications built using AWS.
- The monitoring service helps you track different elements on a vast platform similar to AWS.

The services that you will learn about in this session are mentioned in the images given below.

**Important note:**

A few important points to note before proceeding with the session are as follows:

- You must use the services covered in the session wisely. Similar to other AWS services, these services are also paid services, but the usage charges are higher; hence, you must be more cautious.
- Make sure that the working region is N.Virginia (us-east-1) and not ap-south-1, as all the services are accessible through this region. To set the default region, use the following command:

    `aws configure set default.region us-east-1`
