# Traditional Computing vs Cloud

In this segment, you will learn about the traditional process followed before the evolution of cloud. Then you will get a brief understanding of cloud and how it helped solved the problems faced with the traditional process. So, let’s first understand the computing method that was followed before cloud.

So, you learnt that traditional data centres are deployed in two ways, which are as follows:

1. **On-premises:**
   
   - In this setup, the organisation sets up and maintains the data centre by itself. It also owns all the equipment.
   
   - In some cases, networking between the data centre and the organisation’s office is taken care of by the network service provider.

2. **Colocation:**
   
   - In this setup, the organisation ties up with a third-party firm to set up and maintain its data centres.
   
   - The organisation provides the required computer servers, storage and networking, whereas the third-party firm provides the power, cooling and physical security.
   
   - In some cases, networking between the data centre and the organisation’s office is taken care of by the network service provider.

Switches and routers are used to connect servers to make up a network. They are essential networking basics that enable devices inside a network to communicate with each other, as well as with other networks. The points below give a basic description of these elements.

- Switches are used to connect multiple devices on the same network within the data centre. A switch will connect servers and create a network of shared resources, serving as a controller, allowing these devices to share information and talk to each other.
- Routers, on the other hand, are used to tie multiple networks together. So, you could use a router to connect your networked servers to the internet. They will analyze the data being sent over a network, change how it’s packaged and send it to another network, or over a different type of network.
- Servers are used to store data and execute tasks.

You also learnt about the problems faced with traditional data centres. Now, try to attempt the following question.

#### Traditional Data Center

Qn: Which of the following is/are a disadvantage/s of a traditional data centre?

- High manual effort to maintain a data centre

- Time-consuming

- Higher costs

- All of the above

Ans: D. *In a traditional data centre, all of the required setup should be maintained by the organisation; this requires high manual effort for maintaining the data centre. Setting up such data centres also requires a good amount of time. In addition, maintaining the required cooling, power backup, etc., leads to an overall increase in the cost.*

Because of the limitations and disadvantages of the traditional data centres, there was a need for a more efficient way of storing data and computing using the concept of cloud computing.

In the next video, you will learn about cloud computing and briefly explore its advantages, and also understand how it helps overcome the disadvantages of using traditional data centres.

**Definition of Cloud computing (NIST - National Institute of Standards and Technology):**

***“A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”***

Here are some benefits of using cloud over traditional data centres:

1. Cloud has the ability to serve on-demand resources such as servers, applications, network configurations and services. Users can provision these resources when required with just a single click.

2. Users can instantaneously (manual or automatic way) increase or decrease the number of resources they require from the cloud.

#### Cloud Computing

Qn: Which of these will cost to a company that uses an on-premises facility?

- Servers

- Power

- Security devices and personnel

- All of the above

Ans: D. *In on-premises solutions, the organisation itself is involved in setting up and maintaining the data centre. All of the equipment is owned by the organisation.*

#### Colocation

Qn: Which of these is not a cost to a company that uses a colocation facility?

- Servers

- Networking

- Power and cooling

- None of the above

Ans: C. *In colocation solutions, the organisation provides the required computer servers and storage,  whereas the third-party firms provide the power, cooling and physical security.*

#### Cloud Computing

Qn: Moving the company to cloud might be less beneficial if the company experiences which of the following?

- Heavy workload

- Predictable and limited workload

- Unpredictable workload

Ans: B. *If a company can predict its workload, then it can set up servers to store and process the data accordingly. It need not worry about adding infrastructure and only has to look after the maintenance of the existing infrastructure. Hence, it may prefer maintaining its own limited and required infrastructure rather moving to cloud.*

In the next segment, you will learn about some technologies that made cloud computing possible.
