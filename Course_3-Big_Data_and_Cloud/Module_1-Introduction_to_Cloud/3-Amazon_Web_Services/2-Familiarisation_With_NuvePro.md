# Familiarisation With NuvePro

For ease of your access, we have set up a lab with a dashboard and portal from where you can easily access AWS and also monitor your AWS usage.

In the following video, you will be familiarised with the **NuvePro dashboard** and also learn about a few best practices that should be followed while using EC2 (AWS service). It is always important to follow these best practices, as they will prevent you from spending AWS credits unnecessarily.

## Notes on the NuvePro Lab

While you are working on your lab, there are some critical pointers that we'd like you to keep in mind. These are as follows:

- It may take some time (up to 3 hours) for your AWS account to get activated after you click the 'Jump to Console' button the first time. Please get in touch with your student mentor if you are unable to access your AWS dashboard even after 3 hours.
- As a general practice, please **shut down** your EC2 instances when you are not using them.
- Your usage bill information is displayed on the left panel of your NuvePro dashboard. Monitor it closely.
- At any given time, you will be assigned a 'budget value'. This value can only be increased in certain steps. You can find out this value from your student mentor. From this budget value, subtract your usage to find how much credit you have remaining.
- Please add the security group of 'MyIP' to your AWS lab before you start any work on your AWS cluster.
- Please find the guidelines in the document attached below.

## AWS upGrad Policy

upGrad is a registered institute at AWS Educate and you are expected to adhere to certain security policies that we continuously keep on re-iterating through different channels.

Please note that this is an official warning from AWS and IIT Madras Academic team.

**Any registered account on AWS Educate registered from upGrad, if not used with proper security policies, will be terminated and will be resumed only when approved by IIT Madras Academic team.**

This might take a few weeks for these accounts to be retrieved. **During this duration, you will not be able to avail AWS services from the upGrad registered account.**

You can create your own individual account and use your own credits to avail the services. **upGrad will not be responsible for monitoring the security policies or credit loss at your individual account.**

Hence, it is strictly recommended to apply proper security policy and then start working on your upGrad accounts. **Under any circumstances, it is mandatory not to change any security policies for any purpose.**

You can always reach out to us if you are facing any issue because of these restrictions (not able to access the resources, not able to run the code etc.) and we will be helping you with the same.

**Under any circumstance, do not work on upGrad registered account without security policies.**

**Note:** By clicking on the next segment, it is considered that you have gone through the guidelines documentation and abide by the mentioned terms and conditions. In the next segment, you will learn about the different basic services of AWS.
