# Identity Access Management Service

By now, you must have understood the answer to the question ‘Why AWS?’ Now, it’s time to explore the different services of AWS and get your hands dirty working with them. But before that, you need to understand where AWS data centres are located and maintained. Let’s learn about it from Vinod in the following video.

So, AWS data centres are located in various geographical locations called **Regions**. The image below shows all the regions of AWS as per December 2019.
