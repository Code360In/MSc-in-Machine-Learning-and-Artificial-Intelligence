AWS provides a price calculator tool that reads the types of services and some usage values as input and gives an estimated monthly cost. In the following video, you will learn how to estimate the cost based on the usage of resources. Please find the AWS price calculator tool [here](https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
