Qn: An organisation called 'SocOrg’ is using 25 physical servers in its data centre to run 25 different operating systems. Now, they want to reduce the number of servers they use but not the number of operating systems. Which of the following allows them to do this?

- Virtualisation

- On-premises solution

- Colocation solution

- None of the above

And: A. *Virtualisation is a process of creating a virtual physical environment. It provides a virtual partition of the CPU, storage, etc., which allows you to virtually partition single physical hardware (server) into multiple virtual machines. Therefore, you can use only one server and launch multiple virtual machines on top of it. This way, ‘SocOrg’ can decrease the number of servers they use.*

Qn: Which of the following approaches allows you to switch from one cloud service provider to another, along with the IT infrastructure?

- Measured Services

- Rapid Elasticity

- Infrastructure as Code

- Virtualisation

Ans: C. *Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning cloud resources through definition files such as JSON files. Once the JSON file is populated with the necessary infrastructure requirements, it can then be fed into tools that are connected to the cloud service provider to create the infrastructure.*

Qn: Let’s say SocCorp, an IT organisation, dedicated the resources for each employee using its on-premises data centre. Few users are facing a shortage of resources, and the resources allotted to the other users are getting wasted. To solve the issue, the organisation decided to move its systems to the cloud. Which characteristic of the cloud will best fit to solve the issue?

- Broad Network Access

- Resource Pooling

- Measured Services

- None of the above

Ans: B. *With the given resources, resource pooling enables the users to share the resources among themselves. Hence, both wastage and shortage will not occur at the same time. If there is a shortage for some users, they can access the shared resources.*
