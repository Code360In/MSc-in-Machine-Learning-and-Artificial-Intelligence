# Introduction

Welcome to the Case study on Data Warehousing and Data Management.

Let’s start with a quick introduction by Ganesh in the following video.

**VIDEO**

So far in the course, you have learnt about the Hadoop framework, where you got an understanding of the storage layer, which is the **Hadoop Distributed File System**, and then the processing component, which is **MapReduc**e. Then you learnt **SQL** to equip yourself to write **Hive queries**. Hive provides an SQL-like interface to query data stored in a big data framework.

In this case study, you will go through a real-world use case from the Telecommunications industry.

Similar to the BFSI or the healthcare industry, the telecommunications industry deals with big data situations. Now, these situations involve data generated across a number of devices such as towers, routers, billing gateways and many more. Collecting, storing and analysing this data to generate insights involves using various big data tools. In this case study, you will learn about some of the tools that are used widely for handling big data, such as Sqoop and Oozie.

You can download the technical documentation for this session to perform the steps shown in the demonstration. Note that this is only a reference document and might require you to make certain changes while executing the commands at your end. Folder names, file paths and host addresses are some of the common things that you need to take care of.

This module is more hands-on-based, and so, it is highly recommended that you keep aside sufficient time to try it out yourself. Also, make sure to explore more on the topics/commands shown in the demonstration in order to gain an in-depth understanding of different tools.

## In this session

You will learn about the following topics:

- Understanding ETL

- Data Ingestion

- Source setup I - Creating MySQL tables on an RDS instance

- Source setup II - Loading data into MySQL tables
