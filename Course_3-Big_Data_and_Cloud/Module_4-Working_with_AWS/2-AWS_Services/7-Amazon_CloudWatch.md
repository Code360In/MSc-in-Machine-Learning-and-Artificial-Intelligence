# Amazon CloudWatch

In this segment, you will learn about a monitoring service offered by AWS that can be used to track the usage of all the resources in the AWS Cloud. Let's get started by watching the upcoming video.

**VIDEO**

Amazon CloudWatch is a unified platform on which you can monitor all the AWS resources, applications and services through associated logs, metrics and events. It serves as a useful tool for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs) and IT managers since all the resources can be monitored under a single service.

Cloud Watch

Amazon CloudWatch collects all the data and helps with visualising it in the form of automated dashboards. These dashboards help with tracking the usage and health of each resource in the Cloud infrastructure. You can easily find areas of improvement or possible failures by keeping an eye on the desired metrics for each service. This leads to better management and optimisation of processes and costs. Take a look at the image given below to understand the working of CloudWatch.

Amazon CloudWatch finds useful applications in every project, as it makes the task of handling the Cloud resources easier. You can go to this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/customers/) to learn how different companies use this tool.

Now, considering pricing, the amount varies depending upon the function that you want to use the service for. Since it is one of the most used services, and it helps save a huge amount of additional costs, Amazon has priced the service accordingly. You can visit this [page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) to explore the pricing for this service.

With this, we have come to the end of the second session of this module. The next segment summarises the learnings from this session.
