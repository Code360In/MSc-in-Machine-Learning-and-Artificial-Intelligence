# Introduction

Welcome to the second session of the module on **‘Applications in AWS’**.

## In this session

The first session of the module laid the foundation for using AWS. Now, in the forthcoming video, we will see what this session has in store for you.

**VIDEO**

In this session, you will learn about Software Development Kits (SDKs) and understand how they are used to build an application. You will also try your hands on one of the SDKs provided by AWS to access its services through Python.

In the end, you will learn how to build a simple application in AWS using the Python SDK. This activity is expected to bring together the concepts from the previous sessions to give you an idea of application deployment on the Cloud. So, let’s get started.

**Important note:** This module involves a lot of demonstrations, as you will learn how to build an application using all the services that you have learnt about so far. You will come across a new coding paradigm while working with SDKs. This might get challenging, and so, we suggest that you pay close attention to each step that is being followed. Also, it would be better if you create flow charts to keep track of the steps being performed. This will help you gain clarity on the tasks and also build a revision document for future reference.

Make sure that the working region is N.Virginia (us-east-1) and not ap-south-1, as all the services are accessible through this region. To set the default region, use the following command:

`aws configure set default.region us-east-1`

Also, as part of this session, you are expected to apply the learnings from the previous sessions to code along with the instructor during similar tasks associated with the AWS CLI. Therefore, code is not provided throughout the session. You can revise the code used in the previous sessions for better clarity if you are stuck at any point during the lectures.
