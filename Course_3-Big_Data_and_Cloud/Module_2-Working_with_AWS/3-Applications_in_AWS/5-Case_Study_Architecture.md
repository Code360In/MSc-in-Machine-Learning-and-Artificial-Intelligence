# Case Study: Architecture

In this segment, you will be working with the following services to build an application to recognise celebrities in an image:

- **Amazon S3:** To store images
- **Amazon EC2:** To host the application/Jupyter Notebook
- **Amazon Rekognition:** To detect celebrities
- **Amazon RDS:** To store the results in a database
- **AWS Lambda:** To call AWS services in the Notebook

You have all the resources defined now. Let's watch the forthcoming video to understand how they will be connected to each other (application architecture).

**VIDEO**

So, here is the architecture of the application that you are going to build.

Now you can start implementing the codes to develop the application, as we will see in the next segment. You can refer to the following document for each step implemented in the process. However, you are expected to pay attention while watching the videos as the syntax and role of each command have been iterated or explained in the videos only.
