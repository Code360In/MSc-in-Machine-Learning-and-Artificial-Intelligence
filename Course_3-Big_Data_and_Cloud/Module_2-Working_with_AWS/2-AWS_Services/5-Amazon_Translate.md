**VIDEO**

As the name suggests, Amazon Translate translates text from one language to another. The service is highly accurate and evolves with every job that is run on it. It supports 54 different languages that are listed on the service page. The key advantage of using this service is that entities such as popular brand names and industry terms are kept intact in the translated text. You can even define custom terminologies to do the same for items specific to your job.

As discussed in the video provided above, this service can be used for developing websites, documentation, etc., in different languages. This service overcomes all of the challenges of the traditional practices, and provides a quick, accurate and customisable output. Due to this, companies are able to serve a wider customer base from different regions and demographics.

This is also a paid service, and you are charged for each character provided for translation. However, the Amazon Translate Free Tier provides free translation for 2 million characters per month for a period of 12 months. After that, you are billed monthly at a rate of $15.00 per million characters. You can visit this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/pricing/) to check the pricing.
