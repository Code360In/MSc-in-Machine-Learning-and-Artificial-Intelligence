# Amazon Transcribe

In this segment, you will learn about another AWS ML/AI service, Amazon Transcribe, which is a speech-to-text service that transcribes audio in real time. You will learn more about this service from Vinod as he talks about it in the forthcoming video.

Several industries that generate a massive amount of audio data use speech-to-text services in their applications, as it is extremely difficult for any machine to process audio data in raw form. Amazon Transcribe helps convert these audio files to text, which can then be analysed, and the results can be used for further tasks. The case shown below depicts this process.

Amazon Transcribe also has the capability of generating transcripts from a speech in real time. You can generate transcripts of lectures, speeches from key personnel, etc., in real time with the help of this tool. However, this feature is not offered in every region.

This service can also be used for generating subtitles or captions, which can be displayed with videos. The tool further makes this task easier by providing timestamps to map the audio with the text. You can go to this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/customers/?nc=sn&loc=6) to explore different business cases associated with this tool.

However, you must be careful while using this service, as you are charged based on the seconds of audio transcribed per month. The price varies from one region to another. You can visit this [page](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=3) to check the pricing in different regions.

You can refer to this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/customers/?nc=sn&loc=6) for learning about the industrial use cases of the service.

Qn: Is it possible for a person located in Mumbai to transcribe audio in real-time if this service is not offered in that region?

Yes

No

Ans: A. *Even though the service is not offered in the Mumbai region, AWS gives you the option of changing your location and launching the service in a region that supports real-time translation.*

In the next segment, you will learn about another ML/AI service, Amazon Polly, which does the opposite of Amazon Transcribe.
