# Amazon Rekognition

So far, you have learnt about the different services associated with text and audio formats. In this segment, you will learn about Amazon Rekognition, which is a visual analytics service.

Let's watch the upcoming video on AWS Rekognition.

**VIDEO**

Amazon Rekognition is a powerful tool that can be used to perform visual (image and video) analysis in your applications. The video provided above covered the features associated with image analysis. Some of these features include the following:

- **Object and Scene Detection**  
    This feature helps with identifying different objects, such as people and animals, within an image. It also provides details about the scene within an image, for example, whether it has a sunset or a forest, under Scene Detection. This feature is helpful for developing image libraries associated with a particular object or a scene.
- **Facial Detection and Analysis**  
    This feature helps with locating faces within images and analysing attributes such as age, gender and expression associated with them.
- **Unsafe Image Detection**  
    This feature checks images for any explicit or suggestive content so that they can be filtered based on the application requirements.
- **Text in Images**  
    This service can be used to extract text within images.

Amazon Rekognition now also comes with the preloaded PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) detection feature, which automatically detects protective equipment, such as face masks and headcovers.

It does a great job of analysing the different elements associated with an image. It provides a bunch of similar, useful features for video analysis as well. You can explore all of them at [this](http://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) link.

Amazon Rekognition is an extremely powerful and useful tool for companies that work with images and videos.
