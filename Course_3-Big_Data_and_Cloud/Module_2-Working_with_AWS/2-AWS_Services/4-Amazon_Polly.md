Amazon Polly provides a lifelike speech for a given text. It has different features that generate output as per your requirements. From the variety of voices that it offers, you can select one that suits you the most. It even localises the generated audio by providing the option to select different languages and regions.

With the help of the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), Amazon Polly also allows you to add special effects to the audio generated. You can explore all the effects [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supportedtags.html).

The service has multiple use cases across different industries. Some of them are as follows:

- It can be used to generate audio for language learning apps, such as Duolingo, as it provides the feature to generate output in different languages.
- It can also be integrated with navigation services. You can use the tool to generate audio directions based on the path to your destination.
- You can also use this tool to create audiobooks.
