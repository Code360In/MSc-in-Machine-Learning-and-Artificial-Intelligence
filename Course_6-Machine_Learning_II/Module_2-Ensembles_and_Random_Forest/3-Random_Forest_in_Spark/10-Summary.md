# Summary

You have now come to the end of the session. Let’s summarise the elements covered in this session in the upcoming video. 

**VIDEO**

In this session, you first learnt how to build a random forest model in the PySpark environment. For this, you used the Chicago crime data set to recommend the FBI code for a crime based on its attributes. Then, you learnt how to optimise the algorithm in a distributed environment using data-parallel optimisation and task-parallel optimisation techniques.

By now, you have had some experience with multiple models and are well versed with the elements associated with them. The next module is an assignment that will test this understanding and help you to apply all the concepts covered so far.
