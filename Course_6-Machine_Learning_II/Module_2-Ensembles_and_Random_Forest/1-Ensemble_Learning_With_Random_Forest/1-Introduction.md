# Introduction

Welcome to the module on '**Ensembles and Random Forest**'. 

You learnt about the first tree model 'Decision Trees' in the previous module. While the model is highly interpretable, it had some issues such as overfitting, which made it less accurate. In this module, you will learn about Random Forest, which is one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning. It is a collection of decision trees, combined through the techniques of Ensemble Learning to overcome the challenges.

## Introduction to the module

In this video, our industry expert will give an overview of the topics covered in this module.

As part of this module, you will gain an understanding of **Ensembles** and learn how they form the basis for another ML model, **Random Forests**. In this module, you will learn how an ensemble performs better than general ML models. You will also get to learn about different ensemble techniques used in the industry.

Once you gain an understanding of ensembles, you will learn how ensembles and decision trees come together to form a random forest model. The module will cover the working of the algorithm, and you will learn about the strengths and weaknesses of the model. You will be exposed to other nitty-gritties such as feature importance, hyperparameter tuning, time complexity and optimisation techniques that are associated with the model.

Finally, you will go through some case studies to get an in-depth understanding of the model:

-   Heart disease prediction using an RF classification model in Python
-   Housing price prediction using an RF regression model in Python
-   Model comparison using a telecom churn case study
-   Chicago crime analysis using an RF classification model in PySpark

Random forest tries to overcome different challenges present in the other models that have been covered so far. Decision trees offer high interpretability but lack robustness owing to a high variance. Linear regression and logistic regression, on the other hand, provide robustness but involve additional steps to bring the data in the required shape for modelling. Random forest tries to combine the positives of both the models and makes the task as easy as possible. In this module, you will learn how it can achieve this.

## Introduction to the Session

The first session of this module will help establish a base for you to understand the Random Forest model. In this video, you will gain an understanding of the topics that will be covered in this session.

**VIDEO**

One of the leading companies in the world, **Microsoft**, uses the Random Forest algorithm in its gaming console Xbox to provide motion-based video games. The gaming console performed better in sensing the movements of a player than all the other consoles. It reflects how this algorithm can help solve complex problems. 

As mentioned in the video, you will learn about the following components in this session:

-   Introduction to Ensemble
-   Ensembling techniques: Simple and Advanced
-   Ensemble Learning in ML
-   Random Forest algorithm
    -   Definition: Ensemble of Decision Trees
    -   Building a Random Forest model (Python and Spark)
    -   Model evaluation: Out-of-Bag (OOB) Score
    -   Advantages and disadvantages
    -   Industry applications
