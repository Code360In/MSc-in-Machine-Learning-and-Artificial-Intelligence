# Introduction

Welcome to the session on ‘Implementing Decision Trees’. In the previous session, you learnt the basics of a Decision Tree and its mathematical implementation. In this session, you will recall all that you have learnt so far and implement Decision Trees in both Python and Spark. Let’s watch the following video where Sajan will introduce the session:

In this session, Sajan will take you through the implementation of Decision Trees in Python and Spark. This will be followed by a few short case studies, which you will solve in order to better understand these concepts. 

## In this session

You will learn about the advantages and disadvantages of Decision Trees, their implementation in Python and Spark, and suitable methods to help you overcome some of their disadvantages. Let’s take a look at the upcoming video where Sajan will walk you through the topics to be covered in this session.

The topics that you will cover in this session are as follows:

1.  Advantages and Disadvantages of Decision Trees
2.  Code Implementation in Python using Sklearn
3.  Overfitting and Pruning
4.  Hyperparameter Tuning
5.  Code Implementation in Spark using LIBSVM
6.  Code Implementation in Spark: Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

Let’s now proceed and learn about the implementation of Decision Trees in detail.
