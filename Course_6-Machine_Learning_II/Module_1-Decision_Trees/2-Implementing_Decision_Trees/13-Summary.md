# Summary

You have successfully completed the module on Decision Trees. In the upcoming video, Sajan will summarise the session for you.

**VIDEO**

To summarise, in this session, you covered: 

1.  You learnt the industry use cases of Decision Trees and implementing case-studies on the same.
2.  Advantages of Decision Trees and when to use them over Logistic Regression.
3.  Disadvantages of Decision Trees and how to handle them using hyperparameters.
4.  Overfitting, one of the major issues faced by Decision  Trees and how to avoid overfitting.
5.  Introduction to pruning and its types:
    1.  Pre-pruning or Truncation
    2.  Post-pruning 
6.  Hyperparameter tuning using the following methods:
    1.  Max_depth
    2.  Min_sample_leaf
    3.  Min_sample-size, etc.
7.  You also implemented Regression Decision Trees through a LibSVM case study in Spark.
8.  Next, you implemented Classification Decision Trees - Credit card fraud detection case study and its pipeline implementation.
9.  You learnt methods of optimising Decision Trees in Spark using the following methods:
    1.  Distributed Decision Trees in Spark.
    2.  Level-wise training and binning in Spark
    3.  Binning
