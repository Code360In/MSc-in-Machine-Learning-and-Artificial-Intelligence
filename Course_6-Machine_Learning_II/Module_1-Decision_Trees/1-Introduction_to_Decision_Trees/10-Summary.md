# Summary

Let us summarize the learnings of this session in the upcoming video:

**VIDEO**

So far, you have covered the following:

1.  Logistic Regression is not the best choice of algorithms when it comes to multi-class data or missing values in the dataset. In such cases, Decision Trees can be employed.
2.  Decision Trees are a supervised learning algorithm that can work for both categorical and continuous variables.
3.  You studied the different components that form a Decision Tree i.e., the root node, leaf node, splitting, splitting criteria etc.
4.  You created the tree for the coronavirus case-study for both classification and regression problems.
5.  The session introduced to you the concept of homogeneity and purity and how to calculate them for both continuous and categorical target variables. For categorical target variable, you can use entropy/ Information Gain or Gini index as the splitting criteria, which varies with the algorithm. For continuous target variables, you can use Standard Deviation = root(Variance) = MSE.
6.  Decision Trees with categorical target values are known as Classification Trees while Decision Trees with continuous target values are known as Regression Decision Trees.
7.  How to construct Categorical Decision Trees using information gain, which is the difference in entropy before and after the split. You learnt how the root nodes is selected by trying out the different splits for all the features and selecting the split and the feature which gives maximum information gain.
8.  You learnt how to construct Regression Decision Trees using Standard Deviation/Variance as the splitting criteria and implement it on a dataset.
9.  Two mainly used Decision Tree algorithms:
    1.  ID3: Can handle only categorical features for classification tasks
    2.  CART: Can handle categorical as well as continuous features for classification as well as regression tasks
10.  You also learnt about classification and regression trees(CART) and Gini Index in detail and how to perform calculations
11.  Lastly, in this session, you covered the advantages and disadvantages of CART.
