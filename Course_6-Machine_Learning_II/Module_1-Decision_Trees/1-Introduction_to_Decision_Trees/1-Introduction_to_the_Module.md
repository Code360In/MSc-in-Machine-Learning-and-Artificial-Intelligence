# Introduction to the Module

Welcome to the course ‘Tree Models’. In this course, you will study two extremely popular machine learning models —  Decision Trees and Random Forests.

  
You have already learnt about Linear and Logistic Regression models in the previous course. Similar to them, Decision Trees also fall under supervised learning methods as they have pre-defined train and test data. Now, in this course, you will be introduced to the Decision Tree and Random Forest model.

## In this module

Welcome to the module on ‘Decision Trees’. 

Decision Trees as the name suggests builds a tree structure for the process of decision making. Similar to linear and logistic regression, Decision Trees are very intuitive and hence are widely used in the industry where model explainability takes precedence over model accuracy.

The first module in the course on Trees is ‘Introduction to Decision Trees’. Let us hear our industry expert giving an overview of the topics covered in this module.

With high interpretability and intuitive nature, decision trees mimic the human decision-making process and excel in dealing with categorical data. Unlike linear algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees do not find a linear relationship between the independent and the target variable. Rather, they can be used to model highly nonlinear data.

With decision trees, you can easily explain all the factors or rules leading to a particular decision/prediction. Hence, they are easily understood by people. They form the building blocks for Random Forests, which is one of the very popular algorithms that you will be learning after Decision Trees.  
 

## In this session

This session will help you understand the basics of Decision Trees and understand their working in detail. Let us hear about the topics that will be covered in this session.

**VIDEO**

Decision Trees help you to compute decisions using tree structures. As mentioned in the video, you will be introduced to the following topics in this session:

1.  Limitations of Logistic Regression
2.  Introduction to Decision Trees
3.  Different Components of Decision Trees
4.  Decision Trees for Classification and Regression
5.  ID3 & CART Algorithms
