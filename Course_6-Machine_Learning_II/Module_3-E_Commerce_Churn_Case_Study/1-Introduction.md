# Introduction

You are well-versed with multiple ML models. Some of them are as follows: 

-   Regression models
    -   Linear regression
    -   Logistic regression
-   Tree models
    -   Decision trees
    -   Random forest

You have already learnt how these models can be used to solve both regression and classification problems. Now, it is time to put all this understanding to test. Even though you have a variety of models, you must always select the model which serves your purpose the best.

This assignment will help you develop that skill, as it requires you to choose the suitable model to predict whether the customer will purchase a product or not. The aim is to compare the models built with different algorithms and then suggest the most ideal one for the problem.

In the following video, let’s hear about the problem from Sajan as he provides a broad overview of the assignment.

As part of the assignment, you are expected to complete the following tasks:

-   Task 1: Data Exploration
-   Task 2: Feature Engineering
-   Task 3: Model Selection
-   Task 4: Model Inference

Churn prediction is one of the most common classification problems in the industry, especially in e-commerce. Many companies try to predict the purchase of an item based on customer behaviour. In the following video, let’s try to understand the process and the features that may impact the decision of a customer.

The video given above explains a basic sales funnel, which includes the following stages:

-   View
-   Cart
-   Purchase

The sales funnel accurately captures the entire journey of a customer for the purchase made. It also reflects the notion that there is a drop in the number of users at every step, and only a limited number of individuals out of the total reach the final stage of purchase (churn). Companies try to increase the efficiency of the sales funnel, as it may result in more number of individuals reaching the final stage and help in increasing the revenue of the company.

In the next segment, you will learn about the problem statement in detail.
