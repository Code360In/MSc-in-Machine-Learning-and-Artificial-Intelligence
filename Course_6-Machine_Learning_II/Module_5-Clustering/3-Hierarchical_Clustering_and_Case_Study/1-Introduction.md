# Introduction

Welcome to this session on 'Hierarchical Clustering'. In the previous sessions, you developed an understanding of what clustering is and learnt how to use the K-Means algorithm to create clusters in your data set. You also saw the execution of the K-Means algorithm in Python.

## In this session

You will learn about another important algorithm to perform clustering, which is called Hierarchical Clustering. Let's watch the next video to learn more about it.

**VIDEO**

As you learnt in the video above, in Hierarchical Clustering, instead of predefining the number of clusters, you have to first visually describe the similarities and/or dissimilarities between different data points and then decide the appropriate number of clusters based on these similarities and/or dissimilarities.

The following topics will be covered in this session:

-   Hierarchical clustering algorithm

-   Interpreting a dendrogram

-   Types of linkages

-   Bisecting K-means algorithm
