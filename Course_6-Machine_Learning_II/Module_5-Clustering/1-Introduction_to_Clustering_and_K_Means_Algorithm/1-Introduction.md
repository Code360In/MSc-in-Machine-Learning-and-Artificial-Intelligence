# Introduction

Welcome to the module on '**Clustering**'. In the earlier modules, you learnt about various supervised learning techniques such as regression and classification. These techniques use training data to make the algorithm learn, and then apply what is learnt to new, unseen (testing) data points. You also learnt about specific unsupervised learning techniques such as the association rule mining algorithms, particularly the apriori algorithm for market basket analysis.

In the previous module, you learnt about principal component analysis, a dimensional reduction technique that comes under unsupervised learning algorithms. In this module, you will learn about clustering, which is one of the most important unsupervised learning techniques used for identifying patterns in data.

## In this module

You will be introduced to clustering. You will learn about two of the most commonly used types of clustering algorithms: **K-means clustering** and **hierarchical clustering**, as well as their application in Python. Next, you will go through a case study discussing the applicability of clustering in the gaming industry.

## In this session

You will first learn about clustering, an unsupervised learning technique, wherein you try to find patterns based on similarities in the given data. You will learn about the process of segmentation and understand how it is different from clustering. Further, you will be introduced to one of the most popular clustering algorithms known as the K-means algorithm.
