# Segmentation

As you learnt in the previous segment, one of the primary use cases of clustering lies in the field of market segmentation. In this segment, you will learn more about customer segmentation and the different types of segmentation used in the industry.

Customer segmentation for targeted marketing is one of the most significant applications of clustering algorithms. As a manager of an online store, you would want to group customers into different clusters so that you can create a customised marketing campaign for each group. Note that in this case, you have no preconceived notions about any labels in mind such as ‘good customer’ or ‘bad customer’. Instead, you look for patterns in the customer data and then try to identify various segments. Now, this is the stage at which clustering techniques can help you in segmenting the customers. Clustering techniques use raw data to form clusters based on common factors between various data points. This is exactly what is done in segmentation; various people or products are grouped together based on similarities and differences between them.

For a successful segmentation, the segments formed must be stable. This means that one particular person should not fall under different segments after segmenting the data on the same criteria. Segments should have intra-segment homogeneity and inter-segment heterogeneity.

In the next video, you will learn about the different types of customer segmentation.

In the video above, you learnt about the three types of segmentation used for customer segmentation, which are as follows:

-   **Behavioural segmentation**: This segmentation is based on the actual patterns displayed by consumers. You will learn about the different types of behavioural segmentation used in the industry in the subsequent sessions.
    
-   **Attitudinal segmentation**: This segmentation is based on the beliefs or intents of people, which may not translate into similar action.
    
-   **Demographic segmentation**: This segmentation is based on the profile of a person and uses customer information such as age, gender, residential address, locality and income.
    

Now that you have understood the difference between clustering and segmentation, in the next segment, you will learn about the broad categories of clustering and the different types of clustering methods used in the industry.

#### Types of Segmentation

Qn: A telecom company classifies its prepaid mobile customers into three types, mainly based on the number of times they recharge their mobile numbers every month. Which type of segmentation is this?

- Behavioural segmentation

- Attitudinal segmentation

- Demographic segmentation

Ans: A. *Recharging phones is a behaviour, which can be observed, as opposed to attitude, which is the mindset of the customer.*

Qn: An international food and beverage company wants to determine what type of products it should launch in India. For this, it tries to segment the market. It is known that people living in the same area and having similar salaries have similar eating habits. So, which of the following can be segmented into one group? (Options in a pair of brackets indicate one segment.)

A. A high-earning individual from Bengaluru

B. A low-earning individual from rural Uttar Pradesh

C. A mid-earning individual from Mumbai

D. A high-earning individual from Hyderabad

- (A, B, C, D)

- (B, D) - (A) - (C)

- (A, D) - (B) - (C)

- (A, C, D) - (B)

Ans: C. *You want to ensure that the people in one segment are extremely similar and the people in the other segments are extremely dissimilar. So, option C is a good segment to make.*
