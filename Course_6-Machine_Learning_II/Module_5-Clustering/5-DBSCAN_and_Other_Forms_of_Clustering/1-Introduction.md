# Introduction

Welcome to the session on ‘DBSCAN’. In the previous sessions, you learnt about two important clustering algorithms: K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms.

## In this session

You will learn about one of the most powerful clustering algorithms: DBSCAN. In the first session of the module on clustering, you learnt about the following classes of clustering techniques: Partition Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Density-Based Clustering, Distribution-Based Clustering and Fuzzy Clustering. K-means clustering is a type of partition-based clustering, whereas agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering are two types of hierarchical clustering. 

**D**ensity-**B**ased **S**patial **C**lustering of **A**pplications with **N**oise (DBSCAN) is a well-known data clustering algorithm that is commonly used in data mining and machine learning and is implemented as a type of density-based clustering.

In the upcoming video, Ankit will briefly introduce you to the DBSCAN algorithm.

Similar to hierarchical clustering, the DBSCAN algorithm does not require you to predefine the number of clusters. The fundamental idea of DBSCAN is based on the fact that clusters are dense regions in the data space, which are separated by regions of lower density.
