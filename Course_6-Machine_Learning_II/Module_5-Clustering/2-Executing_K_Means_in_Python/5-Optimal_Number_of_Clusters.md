# Optimal Number of Clusters

Now, you might be wondering we have taken 3 as the number of clusters and not any other number. In the previous segments, you learnt about the two techniques that can be used to find the optimum number of clusters, the elbow curve method and the silhouette score method. In the upcoming video, you will learn about both these methods in detail.
