# Summary

With this, you have reached the end of this session. Now, let's summarise your learnings from this session.

You learnt how to create clusters using the K-means algorithm in Python. For this, you performed an analysis on the data set of an online store, wherein you grouped the customers of the store into different clusters based on their purchasing habits. The different steps involved  in this process were as follows:

-   Treating missing values
    
-   Transforming data
    
-   Treating outliers
    
-   Standardising data
    
-   Finding the optimal value of K
    
-   Implementing the K-means algorithm
    
-   Analysing the clusters of customers to obtain business insights
    

Once you are done with the data preparation step, it becomes easy to implement the K-means algorithm. All you need to do is run the KMeans() function. You only need to decide the number of required clusters beforehand and run the algorithm multiple times with a different number of K before you can determine the most optimal number of clusters.

This is exactly what happens in industry practices. You run the algorithm multiple times with different values of K, and then, pick the clusters that make the most business sense. In fact, the K-means algorithm finds large applications in the industry. For example, it can be used to find the most optimal centre to install mobile towers in by clustering the customers geographically. Similarly, it has wide applications in the field of medical science, where, for instance, patients can be clustered on the basis of their symptoms and then analysed to find the cause of their illness.

However, the K-means algorithm is only one of the clustering algorithms used in the industry. In the next session, you will learn about another clustering algorithm called Hierarchical Clustering, which does not require you to decide the number of clusters beforehand.
