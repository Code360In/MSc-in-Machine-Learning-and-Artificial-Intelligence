# Data Understanding and Data Cleaning

In this session, you will build a clustering model for customer segmentation. The data contains various attributes, such as InvoiceDate, UnitPrice and CustomerID. On the basis of this data, the supermarket wants to segment its customers into clusters based on their shopping patterns. Through this case study, you will learn how to create clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm in Python. You can download the data set for the case study from this [link](https://cdn.upgrad.com/UpGrad/temp/929fe498-1032-4ad6-997e-e3c8c33853ea/Online+Retail.csv).

You can view the final IPython notebook, which can be downloaded from the link given below.

In the next video, Ankit will provide an overview of the data set.

**RFM Analysis**

The three attributes on which you may want to build the model, which include Monetary, Recency and Frequency, are not part of the data set, so you will need to build or derive these from the existing pool of features.

-   **Recency**: This measures how recently a customer has visited the store or made a purchase.
    
-   **Frequency**: This measures the frequency of the transactions made by the customers.
    
-   **Monetary**: This measures the amount of money that a customer has spent on their purchases.
    

Now, let's observe and understand the data using Python.

Since you will be performing a large analysis, it is recommended that you write down the steps first.

Now that you have understood what you need to do with the data set, let's begin with cleaning the data. Let's watch the next video to learn how to do the same.

In the next segment, you will start the data preparation part.
