# Vectors

To visualise the given data for a better understanding, we will take the examples of vectors in a two-dimensional plane. You can extend the plan to as many dimensions as you want.

Let’s hear from Jaidev as he explains the concept of vectors.

**VIDEO**

So, in the video above, you got a basic idea of the concept of vectors. The features of a vector can be summarised as follows:

-   A vector is an ordered collection of numbers. Suppose you have the vector ‘x’ in the n-dimensional space. Now, the elements in the vector ‘x’ will be in an order such that x1 is in the first axis, x2 is in the second axis, x3 is in the third axis and so on, as shown in the image below.

$$X=\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ . \\ . \\ . \\ x_n\end{bmatrix}$$

-   Vector is used to represent a point in space. For a vector ‘v’ in two dimensions,  
    v=[12]

Here, we have taken a vector ‘v’ to represent a point (1, 2) in the two-dimensional space.

**In literature, a vector is represented in the following ways:**

-   A vector is represented in **lower case and bold letters**. Each element of the vectors is a scalar, denoted in lower case letters.
-   A vector is represented in the form of a column matrix (i.e., single-column matrix) whose order is **n X 1**, where ‘n’ is the number of dimensions in the space.

**Scalar multiplication of a vector**

Suppose you have a vector ‘x’ denoting a point (1, 2) in a two-dimensional space. If you multiply this vector by a factor of two, it simply scales the vector ‘x’ by a factor of two, after which the new point that the vector will denote will be (2, 4).

The scalar multiplication of this vector is shown in the image given below.

In the next video, you will learn how the columns of a particular data set can be represented in the form of vectors.

**VIDEO**

The basic purpose of understanding the vectors is to represent the data points of a data set in the form of vectors. Let’s take a look at the data set of different patients containing two columns: Height (cm) and Weight (kg).  
 

![Vectors Patients](https://i.ibb.co/7yN858Q/Vectors-Patients.png)

You can represent this particular data in the form of vectors on a two-dimensional plane, as it only contains two columns.

So, in the graph given above, you can see that there are two axes, Height and Weight. You can represent each point of the data on this two-dimensional plane.

**Vector representation in n-dimensional space**

Each vector contains values representing all the dimensions or variables in the data. For example, if there was a variable ‘age’ included in the data set given above and the first patient was 22 years old, then the vector representing the patient would be written as (165, 55, 22). Similarly, if the data set had 10 variables, there would be 10 dimensions in the vector representation. Similarly, you can extend it for n dimensions or variables.

In the next segment, you will learn about matrices and also learn how to represent vectors in the form of matrices.  
 

**Comprehension:**

Suppose there is a vector ‘v’ [1, 2, 5] in the XYZ plane. As you already know, a vector has a direction as well as a magnitude. The magnitude of a particular vector is defined as the square root of the sum of squares of each value in a vector. Now, based on this scenario, answer the following questions.

#### Vectors

Qn: What will be the magnitude of the vector ‘v’?

- 30

- $\sqrt{30}$

- 1

- 2

- 5

Ans: B. *The magnitude of the vector ‘v’ can be calculated as* $\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2}=\sqrt{1 + 4 + 25}=\sqrt{30}$.

Qn: What is the magnitude of the projection of the ‘v’ vector on the x-y plane?

- $\sqrt{30}$

- $\sqrt{26}$

- $\sqrt{29}$

- $\sqrt{5}$

Ans: D. *This is the magnitude of the projection of the vector on the x-y plane.*
