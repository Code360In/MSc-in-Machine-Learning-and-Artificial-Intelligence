# Vectors and Matrices

In the previous segments, you developed an intuition of what PCA does. In order learn about the PCA algorithm in a detailed manner, you need to have an understanding of the following three tools:

1.  **Summary statistics**: This includes mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation and covariance.
2.  **Vectors**: This involves vector operations such as addition, scalar multiplication and vector representation of the data.
3.  **Matrices**: This includes representation of vectors in the form of matrix, matrix operations, basis and change of basis.

You are expected to go through the optional module on summary statistics before proceeding with this module, which serves as the prerequisite module to understand PCA. In the upcoming video, you will learn about the content flow of vectors and matrices.

Now that you have learnt that most of the calculations on the data sets are done using matrices, in the next segment, you will understand the concepts of vector and vector operations using matrices.
