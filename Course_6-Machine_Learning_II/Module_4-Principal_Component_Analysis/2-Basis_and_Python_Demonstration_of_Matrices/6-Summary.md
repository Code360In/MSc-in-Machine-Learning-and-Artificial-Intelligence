# Summary

The whole session is summarised in the following points:

-   In the first segment, you learnt how to demonstrate the vectors on graphs and represent the matrices as a collection of vectors.
-   In the second segment, you went through the concept of covariance. You also saw that the more is the linear relation between two variables, the more covariance is seen between them.

Covariance is a measure of linearity between two variables.   
**Positive covariance:** It means that if one variable increases, then the other will also increase.  
**Negative covariance**: It means that if one variable increases, then the other will decrease.  
**Zero covariance:** It means that there is no linear relation between the two variables.  
Also, the covariance of variable 1 with respect to variable 2 is the same as the covariance of variable 2 with respect to variable 1.

-   **Basis**: The important points on the basis change are summarised below.

1.  ‘Basis’ is a unit in which you express vectors.
2.  In any dimensional space or matrix, vectors can be represented as a linear combination of basis vectors.
3.  The basic definition of basis vectors is that they are a certain set of vectors whose linear combination is able to explain any other vector in that space.

-   **Change of Basis:** 

In this segment, you learnt how to change the basis using the ‘change of basis matrix’. The main idea behind the change of basis is as follows: 

Suppose you have a point, say (4, 3) in the x-y / i-j basis and you want to represent the same point on $v_1$ (-1, 3) and $v_2$ (2, -1) basis, then you need to represent the (4, 3) point as a linear combination of $v_1$ and $v_2$. So, the coefficient of the linear combination, i.e., (2, 3), will be the new representation of the same point in the be $v_1$ and $v_2$ basis. 

This can be depicted in the following image.
