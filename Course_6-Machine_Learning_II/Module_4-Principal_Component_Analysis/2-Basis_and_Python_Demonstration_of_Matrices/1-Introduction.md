# Introduction

Welcome to the second session of the module on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In the previous session, you learnt about PCA and the meaning of dimensionality reduction. You also learnt about the two essential building blocks of PCA, vectors and matrices.

In this session, you will learn how to perform vector and matrix operations using Python. Once the Python demonstration is done, you will be introduced to another important concept called ‘Basis’.

The broad flow of this session is as follows:

1.  Python demonstration of vectors and matrices
2.  Python demonstration of covariance matrices
3.  Conceptual understanding of the basis
4.  Change of basis
