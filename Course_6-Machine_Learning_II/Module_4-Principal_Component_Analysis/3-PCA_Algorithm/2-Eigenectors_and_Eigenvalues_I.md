# Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues- I

Welcome to the segment on ‘Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues’. Until now, you have learnt about the basics of vectors and matrices. In this segment, you will learn about certain other concepts like, eigenvectors and the associated eigenvalues which are required to understand the workings of PCA.

So, let’s get started!

So, as you saw in the video, under eigenvectors and eigenvalues, you will learn the following topics:

-   Transformation matrix
-   Eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and their properties
-   Concepts of diagonalisation, eigenbasis and eigendecomposition

**VIDEO**

You have already learnt about the concept of **transformation matrix** in the previous segments. Let’s try to recollect that learning here. When a given matrix is multiplied to a vector, then it simply transforms that particular vector to a new vector. 

Now, as you saw in the video above, there is a vector ‘x’, which is represented as:

$x=\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}$

When you multiply this vector ‘x’ with matrix ‘A’, you get the following new transformed vector ‘Ax’:

where  $A=\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\-1&1\end{bmatrix}$ and  $Ax=\begin{bmatrix}2\\0\end{bmatrix}$

Now, can you see that the transformation matrix ‘A’ has transformed the given vector ‘x’ into a new vector ‘Ax’? You can visualise these two vectors ‘x’ and ‘Ax’ graphically as shown below; the given vector ‘x’ is shown in blue and the transformed vector ‘Ax’ is shown in red.

In the next segment, we will extend the concept of a transformation matrix to learn about eigenvectors.
