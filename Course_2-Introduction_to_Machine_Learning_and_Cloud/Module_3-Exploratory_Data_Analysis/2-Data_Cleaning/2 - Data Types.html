<p>In this segment, we will discuss a very important aspect of any data set: Data types. In a particular data set, you have multiple types of variables with different kinds of data types such as integers, string, floats, etc.</p>
<p>For data analysis, you will use the following libraries through the entire module, which you must have already covered in prep content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pandas:</strong>  It is a library to deal with dataframes in Python. Pandas is an acronym derived from panel data. It is solely used for data analysis purposes in Python.</li>
<li><strong>NumPy:</strong>  This library is used for performing numerical operations on data sets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, in the forthcoming video, we will go through the bank marketing data set with Rahim and try to find out the data types that are present in it.</p>

<h4 id="python-libraries">Python Libraries</h4>
<p>Qn: What are the key features of the Pandas library?</p>
<ul>
<li>Data alignment</li>
<li>Memory-efficient</li>
<li>Reshaping</li>
<li>Merge and join</li>
</ul>
<p>Ans: All of the above. <em>Pandas is the library in Python which deals with the data frames. It is very user-friendly while handling big data sets. It is a memory-efficient library. Furthermore, it also provides many other data operations, such as merging, joining or reshaping the datasets.</em></p>
<h4 id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning</h4>
<p>Qn: From the options below, choose the appropriate data type for numeric type of data.</p>
<ul>
<li>int64, object, timedelta[ns]</li>
<li>float64, int64</li>
<li>datetime64, float64, object</li>
<li>bool, datetime64</li>
</ul>
<p>Ans: B, <em>Both float64 and int64 are of the numeric data type.</em></p>
<p>In general, any data set is expected to have data of different types. Here are some examples of data along with their data types.</p>

<h4 id="data-type">Data Type</h4>
<p>Qn: Let’s say there is a column in a dataset which essentially contains numerical values. But its data type is an object, which needs to be rectified and should be converted into int or float type.</p>
<p>Choose the correct command to convert such object type column in a dataframe into integer or float type. Multiple options may be correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>df[“feature”]= df[“feature”].astype(int)</li>
<li>df.[“feature”]= df.[“feature”].astype(int)</li>
<li>df[“feature”]= df[“feature”].astype(float)</li>
<li>df.[“feature”]= df.[“feature”].astype(float)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ans: A, C. <em>These two particular commands can be used to convert any type of variable into int or float.</em></p>
<h4 id="data-type-1">Data Type</h4>
<p>Qn: Find the average age of the customers in the bank marketing data set.</p>
<ul>
<li>51</li>
<li>40</li>
<li>50</li>
<li>41</li>
</ul>
<p>Ans: 41. <em>Convert the age variable into numeric type from object type, which can be an integer, and then find the mean.</em></p>
<pre><code>df['age'] = df['age'].astype('float')
df['age'].mean()
</code></pre>
<p>In the next segment, you will learn about the steps in the data cleaning process, specifically, fixing the rows and columns.</p>
