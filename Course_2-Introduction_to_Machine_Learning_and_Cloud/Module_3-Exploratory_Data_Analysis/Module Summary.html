<p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps data analysts to look beyond data. It is a never-ending process–the more you explore the data, the more the insights that you draw from it. As a data analyst, almost 80% of your time will be spent understanding data and solving various business problems through EDA. If you understand EDA properly, that will be half the battle won.</p>
<p>Now, you should keep in mind that EDA is far more than plain visualization. It is an end-to-end process to analyse a data set and prepare it for model building.</p>
<p>In this module, you learnt about the four most crucial steps in any type of data analysis. These are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gathering data for analysis:</strong>  In the data sourcing part, you learnt about the various sources of data. There are majorly two types of data sources: <strong>Public data</strong> and  <strong>private data</strong>.  Private data has certain associated security and privacy concerns, whereas public data is freely available to use  without any restrictions on access or usage. There are many websites that provide access to public data sets. You also learnt about the basics of web scraping–a process to fetch data directly from a web page.</li>
<li><strong>Preparing and cleaning data:</strong>  In the cleaning process, the main objective is to remove irregularities from a data set. There are many ways to clean data, but the two most important approaches that you learnt as part of the cleaning step are <strong>treatment of missing values</strong> and  <strong>outlier handling</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways to deal with missing values, for example, removing an entire column or rows with missing values. However, you need to remember that it should not affect the data through loss of information. The other method to deal with missing values is to just impute them with other values, such as mean, median, mode or quantiles. The third method is to treat the missing values as a separate category. This is the safest method to deal with missing values.</p>
<p>Next, you learnt about the different methods for analysing variables. These are the methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Univariate analysis:</strong>  Univariate analysis involves analysing a single variable at a time. Variables are of multiple types, for example, categorical ordered and unordered variables, and numerical variables. Univariate analysis offers insights about a single variable and how it varies, and what the counts of each and every category in it are.</li>
<li><strong>Bivariate and multivariate analysis:</strong>  Bivariate/multivariate analysis involves analysing two or more variables at the same time. These analyses yield very specific insights about a data set. You can make various findings through bivariate analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, in the forthcoming video, you will hear from Rahim as he summarizes the key learnings.</p>
