<p>Numerous organizations seek to leverage data analytics to make crucial business decisions. As organizations become customer-centric, they utilize insights from data to enhance the customer experience, while also optimizing their daily processes.</p>
<p>In the forthcoming video, you will hear from Anand as he helps you understand what data in the banking, telecom and HR domains looks like, and how it helps companies make crucial decisions.</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>So, private data has certain security and privacy issues, and it is not available publicly. In the video, you learnt about the use of data in the  <strong>banking</strong>,  <strong>telecom</strong> and  <strong>human resources</strong> sectors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banking data:</strong> Banks use data to make credit-related decisions. This data is very sensitive in nature as it contains details on customers’ transactions, accounts, etc. It is data of the highest security. Banks can use this data to predict which customer is likely to take a loan in the near future, or which customers are interested in investing in term deposits or in any other investing mode. Banks can also use this data to find faulty customers who are not going to pay their loans in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Telecom data:</strong> Telecom companies use data to optimize their plans for the customers and predict customer churn. Telecom data can be used to optimize the coverage area based on the customers’ calls data and their call performance.</li>
<li><strong>HR data:</strong>  HR data analytics helps with identifying and predicting employee behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="telecom-data-analysis">Telecom Data Analysis</h4>
<p>You saw an example of telecom data which contains customer-level information with variables such as contract type, prepaid/postpaid, payment method, average monthly bill amount and whether the person had churned (left the company) or not.</p>
<p>Now imagine a client gave you this data and asked you, “What can you find out from this data set?” Think about any two business problems that can be solved using this data. Write your answer in the space provided below.</p>
<p><em>Suggested</em>: There are two kinds of customers prepaid/postpaid, you can find which kind of customers had more frequency of churning out. Also, you can find out which kind of customers had churned out with respect to their average monthly bill.</p>
<p>In the next video, we will look at the applications of data analytics in retail and media.</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>So, in the video, you saw the applications of data in the  <strong>media</strong> and  <strong>retail</strong> industries.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retail data:</strong>  Retail data analytics helps drive decisions such as product purchasing, pricing and stocking.</li>
<li><strong>Media data:</strong> The media industry uses data extensively to target viewers. Advertisers use data to identify the best avenues for targeting customers, while journalists use data visualisation to aid information.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="eda-application">EDA Application</h4>
<p>Qn: Consider a case of sales forecasting for any clothing brand and choose the correct option(s) carefully. More than one options may be correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the data points like seasons, last year’s weather conditions, electricity tariffs, and holidays, we can predict the sales for this year as well.</li>
<li>Using graphical analysis and statistical methods, we can get an idea about the supply and demand gap at different seasons during a particular year.</li>
<li>The most popular products among customers can be identified through customer reviews and ratings, and focusing more on the most popular products may give yield revenue for the company.</li>
<li>Prices of different clothing items can be revised based on the previous customer responses to a particular variety of clothes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ans: All of the above.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Last year’s sales data can give meaningful insights to predict the sales for this year as well. It can also alert the company regarding certain things that it may have missed out in the last year’s sales.</em></li>
<li><em>Consider that customers were more interested in buying cool printed shirts in the summer, but the company supplied more formal shirts at that time. So, it faced a supply-demand gap in printed shirts. Hence, the inference that can be drawn from experience is that during summer, people prefer buying printed shirts over formal shirts.</em></li>
<li><em>Based on customer requirements during different seasons, it is beneficial to the company to identify the needs of the customers.</em></li>
<li><em>There may be a case in which customers like the cloths of a company, but don’t buy them because of higher prices as compared to another company; hence, based on the data of other brands, this company can regulate its prices in order to boost revenues.</em></li>
</ul>
