# Module Introduction

Welcome to this dynamic module in the field of machine learning on Exploratory Data Analysis, also known as EDA.

## Prerequisite

Before proceeding with this module, you are expected to have a good grasp of the different Python libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The modules for these libraries are provided as part of the optional preparatory content.

## In this module

You will learn how to explore a data set end to end, i.e., you will learn how to extract maximum insight from a data set and how to make useful business decisions based on that insight.

As you move along this module, you will learn about the different steps involved in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and also learn how to draw useful and actionable insights from a given data set. EDA is arguably the most important and revelatory step in any kind of data analysis.

Now, in the forthcoming video, we will quickly go through the module flow with Anand.  

**VIDEO**  

So, having watched the video, you must have a brief understanding of EDA now. This module will cover these broad topics:

- Data sourcing
- Data cleaning
- Univariate analysis
- Bivariate and multivariate analysis

In order to develop an understanding of the practical aspects of EDA, you will be working on a case study using the **‘Bank Telemarketing Campaign’**  data set implemented in Python.

## In this session

You will learn about various data sources. Also, you will learn how to source data from public and private sources. Data sourcing is the very first step of any data analysis activity. You will focus on public data sets, as they are open to use and fetch. Here, you will be introduced to certain useful websites and techniques, such as web scraping, which are used to obtain data from websites.
