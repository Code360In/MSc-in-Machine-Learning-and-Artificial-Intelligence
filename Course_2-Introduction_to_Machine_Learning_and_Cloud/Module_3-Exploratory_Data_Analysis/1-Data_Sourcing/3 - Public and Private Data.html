<p>Data sources can broadly be of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private data</strong>  and</li>
<li><strong>Public data</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Private data</strong>, as the name suggests, is private and belongs to an organization, and there are certain security and privacy concerns attached to data of this type. It is used for the internal analysis purposes of companies in order to gain business and growth insights. Some examples of such organizational private data include <strong>telecom data</strong>,  <strong>retail data</strong>,  <strong>banking</strong>,  <strong>medical data</strong>, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Public data</strong>, on the other hand, refers to data that is available for public use and is offered by many websites, such as government websites and public agencies, for the purpose of research. Accessing this data does not require any special permissions or approval. It is, therefore, called public data.</p>
<p>Also, there are many programming techniques that are used for fetching public data through code. You will learn about them later in this module.</p>
<p>In the forthcoming video, you will learn more about the types of data sources from Anand.</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>So, to summarize, data is of two types, public and private data, and each has its own problems. Public data is not always relevant or useful, and private data is not always available easily.</p>
<p>Moving ahead, in the next segment, you will learn about the different types of private data sources.</p>

<p>Qn: Choose the correct statement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Private data is not available for anyone to use.</li>
<li>Both public and private data can be accessible, but the accessibility of private data needs to be approved by the respective organization for security and privacy purposes.</li>
<li>Public data is never useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ans: The answer is Both. Private data is only available when the organization that owns it gives the approval to use it, but public data is available for all to use, without any legal constraints._</p>
