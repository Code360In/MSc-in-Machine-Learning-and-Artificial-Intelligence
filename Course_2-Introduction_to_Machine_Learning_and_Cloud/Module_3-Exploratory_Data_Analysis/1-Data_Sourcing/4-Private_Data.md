- _Consider that customers were more interested in buying cool printed shirts in the summer, but the company supplied more formal shirts at that time. So, it faced a supply-demand gap in printed shirts. Hence, the inference that can be drawn from experience is that during summer, people prefer buying printed shirts over formal shirts._
- _Based on customer requirements during different seasons, it is beneficial to the company to identify the needs of the customers._
- _There may be a case in which customers like the cloths of a company, but don’t buy them because of higher prices as compared to another company; hence, based on the data of other brands, this company can regulate its prices in order to boost revenues._
