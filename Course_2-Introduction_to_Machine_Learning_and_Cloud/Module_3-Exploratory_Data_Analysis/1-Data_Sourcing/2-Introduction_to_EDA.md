# Introduction to EDA

Now, let’s look at what exploratory data analysis (EDA) actually means.

EDA uses data visualization techniques to draw inferences and obtain insights from them. However, EDA is much more than just plotting graphs or visualizing data. It is more about understanding and studying the given data in detail. Visualization of data in plots/graphs can be considered one of the tools in the EDA process.

EDA also involves preparing data sets for analysis by removing irregularities in the data so that they do not affect the further steps in the process of data analysis and machine learning model building.

In the forthcoming video, Rahim will help you understand the essence of EDA using some practical examples.

You have gone through the utility of EDA, which is:

- To maximize the insight in a data set,

- To detect outliers and anomalies, and

- To test underlying assumptions.

You also saw how a box plot of the  **banking data set** gave the clear idea that more positive responses came from people with higher salaries, because 50% of the data with a ‘yes’ response was within the higher salary region. Nevertheless, people with positive as well as negative responses had almost the same median values.

Now, it is generally believed that a higher discount means more sales. However, from the  **sales** example shown in the video, you understood that after a certain level of discount, sales actually start decreasing. One of the possible inferences that you can draw here is that customers may believe that quality is compromised when a very high discount is offered.

Also, through the e-commerce example, you must have understood that frequent buyers have more returns frequency.

So, now you must have understood that EDA is quite an important exercise before proceeding further with a data set. It does not involve merely finding irregularities in the data, for example, missing values or outliers. It is a combination of fixing the data set for useful purposes and then drawing maximum insight from that data, either by plotting graphs or using statistical parameters.

An essential takeaway here is that EDA should be the first step in any data science/machine learning activity. Based on the results of EDA, companies also take business decisions, which can have repercussions later. Hence:

- If not performed properly, EDA can hamper further steps in the machine learning model building process.

- If done well, it may improve the efficacy of all that you do in the next steps.

The next video will give you an idea about the evolution of EDA and what kind of work has been done before in this field.

Let us listen to our expert, Rahim, as he tells the history of EDA in brief.

In 1977, John W Tukey wrote a book on EDA and developed box plots, which are also called Tukey’s box plots. Since then, many books have been written in the field. You may refer to this [link](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda43.htm#Tukey)  to get the resources of the evolution of EDA.

In the next segment, you will learn about data sourcing and the types of data sources.
