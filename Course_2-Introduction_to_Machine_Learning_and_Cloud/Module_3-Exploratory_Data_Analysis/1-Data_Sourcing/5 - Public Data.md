# Public Data

In this segment, you will learn about the public data sources and the techniques to extract data from them. Public data is available directly over the internet on various platforms. Such platforms can include any open website, for example, government websites or any online learning websites. We will discuss some of them here.

In the forthcoming video, you will hear from Anand as he talks about the types of websites and the sources available to us for accessing public data.

So, from the video, you must have understood how public platforms can be a good source of data. Now, we will quickly discuss some interesting platforms that are helpful for exploring the fields of data analytics and machine learning. These include the following:

- **Kaggle:**  It is a subsidiary of Google LLC. It is an online community of data scientists and machine learning engineers where you can find and publish data sets and explore your own developed solutions on an open web-based environment. Kaggle also organises several machine learning competitions online.  [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/)  is the link to the Kaggle website.
- **UCI Repository of Machine Learning:**  It is also an online community of data science and machine learning engineers. As the name suggests, it is a repository of data sets that are available openly. You can find interesting case studies to explore data analytics and machine learning. [Here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) is the link to the UCI Repository of Machine Learning website.

Given below are the links to some public datasets. You may explore these open sources to get the data.

**GitHub:**  [Awesome public data sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets),  [Github data sets](https://github.com/datameet)

**Open government data set:**  [Open Government data](https://data.gov.in/)

The next segment will introduce you to web scraping, and you will learn how to fetch data from websites using codes.
