<p>Now that you have a clear idea about the process of cleaning a data set, the next step in EDA is to learn univariate analysis. Univariate analysis deals with analysing a single column/variable. In the forthcoming video, you will hear from our expert Rahim as he explains the concept of univariate analysis.</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>The major takeaway from the video is that univariate analysis is nothing new to us. You have performed this step on numerical variables while handling missing values and outliers.</p>
