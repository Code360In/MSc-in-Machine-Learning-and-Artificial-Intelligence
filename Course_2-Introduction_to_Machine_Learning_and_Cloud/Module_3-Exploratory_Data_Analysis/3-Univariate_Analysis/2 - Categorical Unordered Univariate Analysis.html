<p>Univariate analysis involves analysing a single variable at a time. The concept of univariate analysis is divided into the <strong>ordered</strong> and  <strong>unordered</strong> categories of variables. In this segment, you will learn how to conduct univariate analysis on  <strong>categorical unordered variables.</strong></p>
<p>Unordered data is the type of data that does not include measurable terms such as high–low, more–less, fail–pass. Here are some examples of unordered data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The type of loan taken by an individual (home loan, personal loan, auto loan, etc.) does not have any ordered notion. They are just different types of loans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The departments in an organization – Sales, Marketing, HR – are different departments in an organization, with no measurable attribute attached to any term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unordered variables also called <strong>nominal</strong> variables.</p>
<p>An unordered variable is primarily a categorical variable that has no defined order. Let us consider the example of the <strong>job</strong> column in the Bank Marketing dataset. Here, ‘<strong>job</strong>’ is divided into many subcategories, such as technician, blue-collar, services and management. There is no weight or measure assigned to any value in the ‘<strong>job</strong>’ column.</p>
<p>The forthcoming video will help you understand how univariate analysis is performed on unordered variables using the Bank Marketing campaign dataset.</p>

<h4 id="univariate-analysis">Univariate Analysis</h4>
<p>Qn: After analysing the Bank Marketing data set, can you choose which is the unordered categorical variable among all the variables?</p>
<ul>
<li>Marital</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Job</li>
</ul>
<p>Ans: Marital &amp; Job</p>
<ul>
<li><em>There is nothing like order in marital status; it can be either single or married, or divorced, perhaps.</em></li>
<li><em>There is nothing like ordering in the variable job, these are just the types of job in which the people are.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In the video, you can see that married people have been contacted the most by the bank. This can be visualised in Python using this graph.</p>

<p>In bivariate analysis, when you plot variables like marital status, job and education with response variables, you will be in a position to decide which categories in the respective columns have the highest chances of a positive reply.</p>
<p>Moving on, in the next segment, you will learn about categorical ordered univariate analysis.</p>
<h4 id="unordered-categorical-variables">Unordered Categorical Variables</h4>
<p>Qn: Which of the following options are unordered categorical variables? Choose all correct options.</p>
<ul>
<li>The blood group of any person, such as A, B, O or AB.</li>
<li>Gear of a vehicle: 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th gear.</li>
<li>Gender of a person, like male or female.</li>
<li>Various stages of cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ans: A, C</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Blood group does not have any order in them. they are just typical category of blood group.</em></li>
<li><em>Gender is an unordered category, as a person can be male or female; there is no hierarchy in genders.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Qn: Which of the two job categories are the least and the most contacted by the bank respectively?</p>
<ul>
<li>Student and management professional</li>
<li>Housemaid and blue-collar employee</li>
<li>Student and housemaid</li>
<li>Student and blue-collar employee</li>
</ul>
<p>Ans: Student and blue-collar employee. <em>Write a code to find the information about the job variable, and plot the bar graph of the job variable. Once the code is done, then you will get the correct answer.</em></p>
