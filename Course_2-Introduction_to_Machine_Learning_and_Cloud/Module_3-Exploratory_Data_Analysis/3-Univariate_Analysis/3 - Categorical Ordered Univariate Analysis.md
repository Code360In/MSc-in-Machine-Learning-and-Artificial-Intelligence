# Categorical Ordered Univariate Analysis

Ordered variables are those variables that follow a natural rank of order. Here are some examples of categorical ordered variables in the 'bank marketing' dataset:  Age group:  <30, 30-40, 40-50, etc.  Month: Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.  Education: primary, secondary, etc.     The Bank Marketing data set has other ordered variables as well. Let us go ahead and perform ordered univariate analysis on this data set. At the very beginning of the upcoming video, you will see the job variable bar graph, which was already covered by the previous segments.   

Now, let us summarise the major takeaways from the video:

- You saw that _education_,  _poutcome_  and  _response_ are the ordered categorical variables.

- The bank has primarily contacted those customers who have completed their secondary education. You can observe that in this pie chart.

- For the majority of the customers, the previous campaign has not been conducted. You can refer to this bar graph to understand the ‘_poutcome_’ variable more. As you can see, ‘unknown’ has the major share within the ‘_poutcome_’ variable.

**Transition of a Numerical Variable Into an Ordered Categorical Variable**

Let us consider an interesting example from your school life. Suppose you have a data set that contains the marks of all the students in the subject ‘Science’. You are one of the students in that group. These marks can be considered categorical if you divide the total marks into different categories, such as High, Medium, Average, Below Average and Poor. From this analysis, you can determine your rank in the class and also find out how many students scored more marks than you and how far away your score is from the  **mean** or the **average** score.

The important point to note here is that your marks are a numerical variable, which you have then categorized into ‘high marks’ and ‘low marks’. This is an approach that you will need to adopt in the future. You will learn more about this approach in the next segment on numerical variable analysis.  

In the next video, you will understand the basics of statistics and its applications in real-life examples.  

#### Ordered Categorical Variables

Qn: You have already worked with ordered categorical variables before - there is a certain order or notion of 'high-low', 'before-after', etc., among the categories. For example, the days of the week (Monday comes before Tuesday), grades of students (A is better than B), number of overs bowled by a bowler (3, 4, 9), etc. Which of the following are other examples of ordered categorical variables? Choose all correct options.

- Dates in a year, e.g., Jan 2, Mar 15, etc.
- Star rating of a restaurant on Zomato on a scale of 1-5.
- Type of education board - ICSE, CBSE, Maharashtra board, etc.
- Country names

Ans: A, B.

- _Dates are ordered - each day comes before or after a certain day._
- _A rating of 5 is better than 4, 3, 2, 1. Thus, the ratings follow an order._

Qn: Suppose you are given a data set containing the salary details of the citizens of a tier-2 city. The salaries are not provided in a numerical format but is given qualitatively, for instance, higher salary, above-average salary, average salary, below average salary and no income. Based on this data, how can you determine the standard of living of the citizens of this city? What steps would you follow in order to dissect this information? Write your answer in the comment box below.   

Ans: First, you should plot the histogram of each category of salary, or you can find the count of each salary group in the data set. Once you have done this, you can predict which category has the highest count, and based on that information, you can predict the standard of living of the people in this city. Suppose you find that the maximum count is for the below-average salary category and the second highest is for the average salary category; thus, you can conclude that the standard of living of the city’s residents is not very high.
