# Introduction to Univariate Analysis

Now that you have a clear idea about the process of cleaning a data set, the next step in EDA is to learn univariate analysis. Univariate analysis deals with analysing a single column/variable. In the forthcoming video, you will hear from our expert Rahim as he explains the concept of univariate analysis.
