# Summary

In this session, you learnt about the different types of bivariate and multivariate analyses. These are listed below:

- **Analysis between two numerical variables:**  The most important point to remember is that  **correlation** and  **scatter plots** are the best methods to perform analyses on numerical variables. The correlation coefficient indicates how much two numerical variables are correlated linearly. And scatter plots provide the exact visualization between the numerical variables.

As you can observe in the correlation matrix above, among all the combinations in the data set, there is a high correlation between petal length and sepal length, and petal width and petal length.

- **Analysis between numerical and categorical variables:**  This gives an idea about the variation of a particular numerical variable with respect to the different categories of a categorical variable.  **Boxplot** is the best way to look at a numerical variable with respect to a categorical variable. However, boxplots may sometimes not be useful because of the huge difference between the maximum and minimum values in a data set, or due to the the higher concentration of data in the numerical variable. Another approach could be to look into the mean/median or quartiles, which are a more efficient way to deal with a numerical variable when combined with a categorical variable. Take a look at the example given below.

As you can see in the box plot (already explained in the bank marketing dataset) above, customers with a higher salary range are more likely to give a positive response.

- **Correlation versus causation:** This is a very important concept of data anaylsis. It states that correlation is not always related to causation. Although there may be a very high correlation between variables, there may be no causation at all.

- **Analysis between two categorical variables:**  A **bar graph**  is the best approach to analyse two categorical variables.

![Age_Groups_vs_Response_Rate](https://i.ibb.co/cQVFhM6/Age-Groups-vs-Response-Rate.png)

One of the interesting examples, also covered in the bank marketing dataset, is that the bank has mostly contacted people in the age group of 30–50, although people in the age group of 60+ gave more positive responses among all the age groups. This is a very critical inference that the bank can draw, that is, it should contact more individuals in the age group of 60+.

- **Multivariate analysis:** Multivariate analysis yields very specific information about a data set. It basically involves the analysis of more than two variables at a time. For instance,  **heat maps**  are the best way to look at three variables at a time. In multivariate analysis, it is essential to look into the data by grouping variables and inferring decisions from it.

![Bank_Data_Marital_vs_Education](https://i.ibb.co/7bffNsS/Bank-Data-Marital-vs-Education.png)

As you have seen already in the bank marketing case study, single people with tertiary education are more likely to give a positive response to term deposit. And married individuals and those who have completed up to primary education are the least likely to give a positive response.

In the next segment, Rahim will summarize this module on Exploratory Data Analysis.
