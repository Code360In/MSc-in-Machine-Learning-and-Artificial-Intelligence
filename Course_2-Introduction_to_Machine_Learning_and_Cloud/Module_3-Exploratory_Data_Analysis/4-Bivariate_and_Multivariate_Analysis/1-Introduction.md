# Introduction

Welcome to the session on  **‘Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis’**.

So far, you learnt how to preprocess and clean data, and then you performed a univariate analysis on the bank marketing dataset. A univariate analysis includes the analysis of individual categorical variables, such as job, education, response and marital status. It also explains the concept of outliers, and the mean, median or mode of numerical variables, such as salary, balance and age.

Now, consider the graph below, which plots the ‘Response’ and ‘Salary’ columns from the bank marketing dataset. You already plotted this graph in the previous segments. Although the mean, maximum and minimum values are the same, customers with a higher salary range show interest in opening term deposit accounts with the bank. This is nothing but a bivariate analysis, that is, the analysis of two variables/columns in the data set.

## In this session

You will learn how to analyse two or more variables at a time. You will also observe and draw better inferences on the types of customers who are showing interest in opening term deposit accounts with the bank. This will give you better insights and understanding of how to conduct effective marketing campaigns in the future.

**VIDEO**

In the previous sessions, you already learnt about the different types of variables: Categorical and numerical variables. The current session has been divided into these topics based on the different types of variables:

- Analysis between Two Numerical Variables
- Analysis between Numerical and Categorical Variables
- Correlation versus Causation
- Analysis between Two Categorical Variables
- Multivariate Analysis
