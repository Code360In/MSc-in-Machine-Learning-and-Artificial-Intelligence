<p>In this segment, we will discuss the next part of EDA: Multivariate analysis.</p>
<p>So far, you have learnt how two variables can be visualized based on their type, for example, numerical and categorical. Now, we will analyse two variables simultaneously. One of the key features of multivariate analysis is that it gives you a very precise idea about the various elements, since you are now combining multiple variables to visualize the data set. You will learn about this in more detail in the forthcoming videos.</p>
<p>First, you will hear Rahim as he explains his inferences from the bank marketing dataset in the upcoming video.</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>So, in the video, our expert performed a three-variable analysis among education, marital status and response. You can see that people who are married and who have completed just their primary education are the least likely to give a positive response to term deposits. This can be explained by the fact that people educated only up to the primary level are not aware of the benefits of term investments. Also, married individuals need money to fulfil their daily needs, and they require cash-on-hand to buy the daily essentials; hence, they will not prefer investing in term deposits.</p>

<p>In the next video, you will see how job and marital status are varying with respect to the response variable.</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>So, in the video, you saw that the combinations of married with blue collar, entrepreneur and housemaid are the least likely to go for term deposits. The highest rate of positive response came from students with single marital status. The bank should, therefore, consider these aspects before taking any decision.</p>

<p>So, having gone through all of these examples, you must have a clear idea about the EDA process and the various steps involved in it.</p>
