# Correlation vs Causation

In the EDA exercise, it is very important to note that although some numerical variables can sometimes be highly correlated to each other, there may not be a cause of any relationship between them.

In the forthcoming video, you will hear from Rahim as he helps you get a holistic picture of correlation among variables using some compelling examples.

So, the major takeaway from this video is that correlation does not imply causation. In the video, you saw that the number of people who drowned by falling into a pool is not related to movies starring Nicolas Cage. However, if you observe the plot below, then you will notice that there is a very high correlation between them, since both the plots follow almost the same path.

Now, let’s take a look at the next example. In this example, it is quite obvious that the per capita consumption of cheese has no relation with the number of people dying from being tangled in their bedsheets, although the plot shows a high relation between them.

Moving on, in the next segment, you will learn about bivariate analysis using numerical and categorical variables.
