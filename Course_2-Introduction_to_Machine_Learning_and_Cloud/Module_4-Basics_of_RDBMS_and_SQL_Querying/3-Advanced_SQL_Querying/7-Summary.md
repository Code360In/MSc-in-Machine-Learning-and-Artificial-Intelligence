# Summary

In this segment, we will revise the topics covered in this session. We started by revising some set theory concepts using Venn Diagrams and related it to Joins. As the name suggests, the Join keyword is used to join two or more tables by matching the column of one table to that of another. Let us revise all the different JOIN statements:

- **Inner Join:** Combines the rows of two tables that have a matching value or satisfy a given condition.
- **Outer Join:**  Combines all the rows of two tables regardless of whether matching values exist. In case the value in one column does not have any corresponding matching value in another table, the records will be returned to the table with NULL values.
- **Left Join:**  Preserves the rows of the Left table, while attaching the rows of the Right table whose values in the matching column exist in the corresponding column of the Left table.
- **Right Join:**  Preserves the rows of the Right table, while attaching the rows of the Left table whose values in the matching column exist in the corresponding column of the Right table.
- **Cross Join:** Returns all the possible combinations of joining the rows of one table with those of the other table along the matching column.

You also learnt to write queries that involved both Views and Join statements, such as in the use case shown below.

Finally, you learnt to work with SQL-based set operations. Let us revise them again.

Great! You have finally reached the end of this module. You are now expected to go through the module summary, wherein you will find everything that has been covered in this module.
