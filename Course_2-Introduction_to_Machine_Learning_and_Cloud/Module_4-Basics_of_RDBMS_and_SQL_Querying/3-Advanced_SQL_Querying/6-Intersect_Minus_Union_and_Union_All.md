# Intersect, Minus, Union and Union All

In this segment, you will learn about some SQL-based set operations that can be used to combine the data stored in the tables. You will learn about the four types of SQL queries, which are as follows:

1. UNION

2. UNION ALL

3. INTERSECT

4. MINUS

Vishwa will now explain the UNION, UNION ALL and INTERSECT operations.    

**VIDEO**    

In this video, you learnt about three major set-based operations, namely, UNION, UNION ALL and INTERSECT. Let us revise the common set-based operations that can be performed using SQL.

**Note**: Although INTERSECT and MINUS are supported in other SQL-based RDBMS, these operators are not supported by MySQL. Hence, Inner Joins or Nested Queries can be used as an alternative to find the intersection or subtraction between two sets.

In this video, we will look at some use cases of the UNION and UNION ALL operations in MySQL.

**VIDEO**    

In this video, you learnt to work with set operations such as UNION and INTERSECT. With this, we have reached the end of the module. In the next segment, you will find a summary of the topics covered in this session.
