# Introduction

In the previous module, you have learnt how to explore and analyse the data. You are now aware of the different steps to obtain, clean and prepare the data set to find deeper insights using exploratory data analysis.

## In this module

You will learn how to manage data and use it to generate useful insights using another tool. You will be introduced to the concept of  **Relational Database Management System - RDBMS** and will also learn how to write queries to read/write the data from one of the popular RDBMS -  **MySQL**. SQL here stands for  **Structured Query Language**. It is the most ideal tool for someone with no programming knowledge of Python or Java as it uses simple queries to generate insights.

In this module, you will learn about Database Management Systems and how to write queries using SQL. Following is the flow of the module:

- File-handling system versus RDBMS
- Features of an RDBMS
- Relational models and ERDs
- Basic SQL queries:
