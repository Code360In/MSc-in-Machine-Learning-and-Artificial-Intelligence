# Introduction to SQL

In the last session, you learnt about the various features related to an RDBMS. Additionally, you got an understanding of the relational model. Finally, you learnt how to construct entity-relationship diagrams. With this, you are ready to finally get your hands dirty and start writing SQL queries. But before we begin, let’s first understand what SQL is.  

**VIDEO**   

As you learnt in the video above, SQL stands for Structured Query Language. In some applications, it is also referred to as DSL, or Domain Specific Language. SQL is used for managing and manipulating data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS).   

SQL helps you to:

- Create data,
- Manipulate data,
- Delete data, and
- Share data

Why should you learn SQL?

- SQL is  **language-agnostic**, which makes it a language that can be easily learnt and comprehended.
- It is also  **supported by all the modern database systems**  such as Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server and so on.
- In the last session, you learnt how SQL  **fills the gap between Hadoop and Hive**. This is because Hive systems, which are used for big data processing, are also based on the SQL syntax, which is easy and user-friendly.

Now, let’s understand the different types of RDBMS and some practical examples where RDBMS is used.   

**VIDEO**   

Let’s revise some practical applications of RDBMS that you learnt in the video above. Before that, here is a list of the ten most popular RDBMS systems presently used:   

- MS SQL
- MySQL
- Oracle Database
- IBM Db2
- PostgreSQL
- Amazon Aurora
- Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
- SAP HANA
- IBM Informix
- MariaDB

Amongst them, you will be working with MySQL. This is because:   

- It is open-source, meaning it is completely free.
- It supports all the features of an RDBMS.
- It has a wide user community. This means that you can easily find communities that are working with MySQL, who can guide you properly, and after this module, you can be part of that community, too.   

Here are some of the common industrial applications of RDBMS in our day-to-day lives.   

- **The banking sector**: Managing the flow of money from one account to another is a key operation in the banking sector. Because of its ACID properties, RDBMS is the ideal DBMS to handle complex transactional operations.
- **E-commerce websites**: Companies such as Amazon and Flipkart are heavily dependent on RDBMS for operations such as product categorisation, wherein there are relations between different products. For example, when you buy a product, your website provides suggestions of other products that may be relevant to your purchase. (You learnt about this under Association Rule Mining.) However, these websites rely heavily on RDBMS to manage and store these products and relations.
- **Social networking sites**: Every time you log in to your account, Facebook provides suggestions of ‘people you may know’ by analysing your mutual friends. This is done by maintaining the relationships between the different entities (i.e. the different users on the platform). This kind of relational mapping can be stored only with the help of RDBMS.   

Before going to the next segment let's download MySQL workbench and server in your system to perform the queries. You can refer to the following installation guide to download MySQL in your system.
