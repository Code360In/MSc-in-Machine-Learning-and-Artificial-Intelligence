# Views

In the previous segment, you learned about nested queries, which help us use the output from a query to apply further restrictions to get the desired output. In this segment, we will discuss the Views. So what are views? A view is a  **virtual table**  created as a result of operations on a single table or multiple tables. A view can be treated like any other table and can be further updated or deleted. Let’s learn more about this from Vishwa.

In this video, Vishwa explained to us the concept of views. As he mentioned, when you create a view, there is no separate storage layer for storing this table. One major advantage of creating a view is data security. Suppose you have confidential data and you need to make specific columns available to a user who is denied access to the rest of the data. In such cases, views can be used to extract the specific data, which is then shared with the user while keeping the main table hidden. As a result, the end-user can only see the view.    

Let’s now look at some use cases in this case study.

In this video, you learnt how to work with Views. With this, we have come to the end of the second module. In the next module, you will learn how to work with joins. Joins help you merge different tables together. You will learn about the different types of joins and some of their use cases.
