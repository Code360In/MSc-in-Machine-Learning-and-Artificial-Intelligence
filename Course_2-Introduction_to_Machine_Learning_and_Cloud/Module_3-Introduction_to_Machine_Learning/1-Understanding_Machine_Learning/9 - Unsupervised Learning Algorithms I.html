<p>You learnt about supervised machine learning algorithms and understood two fundamental algorithms: regression and classification. You saw an example of how linear regression models can help investment companies predict stock prices. Another example was how classification models can help email service providers classify emails into spam or legitimate.</p>
<p>Both these algorithms operate on the fundamental principle of labelled prediction. That is, you define a target X and subsequently build models to predict its value. In this segment, you will understand clustering and association, which fall under the category of unsupervised learning. As discussed previously, in unsupervised learning, you are not interested in prediction because you do not have a target or outcome variable. The objective here is to discover interesting patterns in the data.</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>Clustering is the process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way or have some underlying pattern.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example to understand this better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume that you are the head of marketing at a multinational retail chain. To boost sales in the coming quarter, you wish to understand your customers’ preferences and scale up your business. Understanding each customer on an individual level is practically impossible. Instead, you can group them and identify target groups based on features such as age, buying frequency and geographical area. This is a classic example of clustering, where you find patterns in data by grouping customers with similar characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common clustering algorithms include K-means clustering and bisecting K-means clustering. The detailed working of these algorithms will be taught in the machine learning modules of the program.</p>
<h4 id="clustering">Clustering</h4>
<p>Qn: Which of the following are applications of clustering?</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysing social media behaviour to determine types of online communities</li>
<li>Identifying consumer segments and their properties to position products appropriately</li>
<li>Identifying patterns of crime in different regions of a city and managing police enforcement based on frequency and type of crime</li>
<li>All of the above</li>
</ul>
<p>Ans: All the above are activities that involve looking at data and identifying underlying patterns. This involves analysing whether some data is different from the rest of the data, and in what aspects it is different.</p>
<p>Qn: A news application classifies news articles based on their content into the following five categories: Sports, Food, Technology, Entertainment and Crime. To increase viewership, an article may be tagged with multiple category names. For instance, an article on the recent data breach at Facebook is best classified into both Technology and Crime instead of a single categorical class. This is an example of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification</li>
<li>Regression</li>
<li>Clustering</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Ans: This is an example of classification. Here, an input sample is classified into multiple categories rather than a single category.</p>
