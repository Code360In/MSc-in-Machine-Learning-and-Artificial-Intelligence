<p>You learnt about some of the applications of machine learning across various domains and understood the broad differences between AI, ML and DL. Now let’s understand why it is essential to know about cloud technologies in order to build machine learning solutions.</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>In summary, a lot of computational power is required to train and build models; in other words, you need powerful machines or servers to build solutions. Cloud makes it possible to store terabytes of data generated in various forms such as weblogs and data from your devices as well as process all of it.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the video, you looked at one of the solutions offered by Google to convert speech to text. You can read more about it  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/reference/rest/?apix=true">here.</a></p>
