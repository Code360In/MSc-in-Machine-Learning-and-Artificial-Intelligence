<p>In the previous segment, you understood what machine learning is by going through a few examples. Now, you will learn and understand the differences between  <strong>machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence</strong>  by looking at an example of a chatbot.</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>You understood the broad scope of artificial intelligence, which includes applications that are as simple as a chatbot or a device that works based on a set of logical rules all the way up to applications as complex as an expert system designed to solve complex problems, such as  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DXplain">Dxplain</a>.</p>
<p>The image below shows a simple chat conversation between a customer and a food delivery app’s chatbot:</p>

<p>Here, you can observe that the bot drives the conversation based on certain pre-built questions and tries to resolve the customer’s issue. This set of questions is nothing but a set of rules defined and programmed into the bot.</p>
<p>These rules can be defined directly or can be learned from the data being generated by customer service agents. When the rules are constantly learned from the data, by feeding it to an algorithm, then it is considered to be machine learning.</p>
<p>To summarize things, there is a very thin line of difference between these three terms. Artificial intelligence is like an umbrella that covers the various applications of machine learning and deep learning. The image below best represents the relationship between these terms.</p>

<p>Qn: You may have heard about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">eight queen problem</a>  in chess. Imagine that you are asked to place the eight chess queens such that no queen threatens or attacks another queen. Is this problem an application of machine learning?</p>
<p>Ans: It cannot be termed as an application of machine learning but can be considered as a simple application of AI, which works based on a set of rules such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>All queens can move in any direction</li>
<li>No two queens may threaten each other</li>
</ol>
