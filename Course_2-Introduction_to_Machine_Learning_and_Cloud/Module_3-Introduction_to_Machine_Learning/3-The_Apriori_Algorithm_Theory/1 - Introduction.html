<p>In the previous session, you learnt about unsupervised learning algorithms. You also learnt about association rule mining and got an understanding of the Apriori algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="in-this-session">In this session</h2>
<p>You will learn about the Apriori algorithm in detail. This session will help you understand the theoretical aspects of the algorithm and help you sequentially understand the process behind it. Let’s start with a quick introduction video by our industry expert, Sajan.</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>Note that the implementation is included in the module but is  <strong>optional</strong>. Please find the entire code for the apriori algorithm in the Jupyter notebook provided below. You can use it while Sajan is explaining the implementation of the algorithm in the next session.</p>
