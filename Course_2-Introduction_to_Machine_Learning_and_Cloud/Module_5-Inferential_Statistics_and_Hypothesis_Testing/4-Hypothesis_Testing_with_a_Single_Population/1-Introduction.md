# Introduction

Welcome to the session on ‘Hypothesis Testing’.

## In this session

The statistical analysis learnt in Inferential Statistics enable you to make inferences about the population mean from the sample data when you have no idea about the population mean. However, sometimes you have some starting assumption about the population mean and you want to confirm those assumptions using the sample data. It is here that hypothesis testing comes into the picture. We will cover the basic concepts of hypothesis testing in this session, which are as follows:

- Relevance of hypothesis testing in business
- Framing a hypothesis
- Hypothesis testing process
- p-value method

In the later segments of this session, you will look at various scenarios involving hypothesis testing. All these scenarios will be covered with proper examples and solved examples.

Let us understand why hypothesis testing is an indispensable tool in today's industry.
