# Framing the Hypotheses

Now that you know the significance of hypothesis testing in business scenarios, let's move forward and learn how you can frame a hypothesis in a given situation.

**VIDEO**

As Amit mentioned, a hypothesis is just a starting point that is open to a test and can be accepted or rejected in light of strong evidence. There are two terms that you came across:

1. Null Hypothesis $(H_0)$: The status quo.
2. Alternate Hypothesis $(H_A)$: The challenge to the status quo.

Let's hear from Amit regarding how to frame a hypothesis.

**VIDEO**

As you saw, to understand the concept of null and alternate hypothesis better, you took the example of the justice system. You might have heard of the very famous saying in the legal system - *"Innocent until proven guilty"*.

![Innocent-Until-Proven-Guilty](https://i.ibb.co/jvymvsj/Innocent-Until-Proven-Guilty.jpg)

This means that when you have a suspect for a crime, he/she is innocent unless you present enough evidence to prove him/her guilty. So, the status quo here is that the person is innocent **(Null Hypothesis)** and the challenge to the status quo is that the person is guilty **(Alternate Hypothesis)**. If you don't present enough evidence to prove them guilty, you go with the status quo and do nothing, i.e., let them go. Otherwise, if you do, in fact, have evidence which proves that they are guilty, you award them with an appropriate punishment.

#### Framing a Hypothesis

Qn: You might know about the ban that was imposed on Maggi noodles for containing excessive amounts of lead. Now suppose you were the agent who was assigned to check whether this is true or not. So you want to perform a hypothesis test to check if they do, in fact, have more than the permissible amount of lead. What would be the null hypothesis that you would frame for the same?

- Maggi noodles contain more than the permissible amount of lead

- Maggi noodles do not contain more than the permissible amount of lead

Ans: B. *Correct! Remember that the Null Hypothesis is the status quo, i.e. in this case, you do not need to take any action. So if you conclude that Maggi does not contain more than the permissible amount of lead, you won't take any action and let the production to run as it is. On the other hand, if you find out that Maggi does contain large lead quantities, you would reject your null hypothesis and take an appropriate action. Hence, you frame the null hypothesis that Maggi noodles do not contain more than the permissible amount of lead.*

#### Properties of Null and Alternate Hypothesis

Qn: Amit mentioned that the two hypotheses are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. What does this mean?

Ans: _**Mutually Exclusive:** In simple terms, this means that the two hypotheses are independent of each other, i.e., they don't overlap. Recall that when you are framing a hypothesis, the alternate hypothesis is just the exact opposite of the null hypothesis. Let's take the dash charger example again. Recall that the null and alternate hypotheses were:_

- _Null Hypothesis (H0): Time taken to charge the phone to 60% = 30 minutes_

- _Alternate Hypothesis (HA): Time taken to charge the phone to 60% ≠ 30 minutes_

_As you can notice, both of these hypotheses cover the complete opposite scenario, i.e., there is no overlap between them. Hence, they are mutually exclusive._

_**Collectively Exhaustive:** This simply means that the null and alternate hypothesis together cover all the possible scenarios. Again in the dash charger example, the null hypothesis states that the time taken to charge the phone is 30 minutes and the alternate hypothesis states that the time taken to charge the phone is not 30 minutes. As you can clearly notice, there is no other event possible outside of these two possibilities. Therefore, since they cover all the situations possible, they are collectively exhaustive._

Qn: The null and the alternate hypothesis divide all the possibilities into?

- 2 overlapping sets

- 2 non-overlapping sets

- 2 sets that may or may not overlap

- As many sets as required to cover all the possibilities

Ans: B. *Correct! Remember that apart from being collectively exhaustive (meaning that they cover all the possibilities), the null and alternate hypothesis are mutually exclusive, i.e. they won't overlap. Take the first question in this quiz for example. The null and alternate hypothesis that you framed were - 'Maggi does not contain excessive amounts of lead' and 'Maggi contains excessive amounts of lead'. These two hypotheses are completely independent of each other, and apart from that also cover all the scenarios possible in this case.*

When you're framing a hypothesis, there are a few rules you should keep in mind. Let's hear what these rules are from Amit.

**VIDEO**

You learnt that in order to define your null hypothesis, you need to be wary of the facts where an action is to be taken. As Amit mentioned, in the dash charger example, the null hypothesis became:

*Time taken to charge the phone to 60% = 30 minutes*

Now, if the time taken to charge the phone comes out to be less than 30 minutes, then you would probably revise your claim to a superior figure since you have a better product. And in case, the time taken is more than 30 minutes, then you would ask the engineers to fix the issue. Since in this case both 'less than 30 minutes' and 'more than 30 minutes' require an action to be taken, the null hypothesis becomes what is defined above. And the alternate hypothesis, in turn, becomes:

*Time taken to charge the phone to 60% ≠ 30 minutes*

You also learnt that the general convention for framing the hypothesis is -

- **Null Hypothesis $(H_0)$:** Always contains equality (=, ≤, ≥)
- **Alternate Hypothesis $(H_A)$:** Always contains an inequality (≠, <, >)

These are just conventions that are followed while framing the null and alternate hypotheses, i.e., there is no logical explanation behind them. You might choose to deviate from this convention at your will according to the problem you have at hand.

**Note**: In the examples shown above, you are testing the initial claim and hence performing the hypothesis test. Suppose the question is framed in a way, that a scientist/researcher is testing the claim. Then you must write the null and alternative hypothesis from their point of view.

Eg. '***A researcher claims that the weight of an average male Bengal tiger is less than 220 KG.**'*

Here the researcher is testing the claim and not you. Hence you must put yourself in their shoes and write the null and alternative hypotheses.

Another point to note is that the researcher is not ***testing the claim***, rather she is herself claiming the statement. Hence, action will be taken if this claim is proved right. Hence this claim will come under the alternative hypothesis.

$H_0 : \mu \ge 220kg$,

$H_A : \mu < 220 kg$

Now, answer the following questions to consolidate your learning about the formulation of null and alternate hypotheses.

#### Null and Alternate Hypothesis

Qn: The average commute time for an UpGrad employee to and from office is at least 35 minutes.

What will be the null and alternate hypotheses in this case if the average time is represented by μ?

- $H_0: \mu \le 35\ minutes\ and\ H_1: \mu > 35\ minutes$

- $H_0: \mu > 35\ minutes\ and\ H_1: \mu \le 35\ minutes$

- $H_0: \mu \ge 35\ minutes\ and\ H_1: \mu < 35\ minutes$

- $H_0: \mu < 35\ minutes\ and\ H_1: \mu \ge 35\ minutes$

Ans: C. _The claim states that the average time for an UpGrad employee to and from office is **at least** 35 minutes or in other words, the average time taken was greater than or equal to 35 minutes. So, that becomes the null hypothesis. Less than 35 minutes becomes the alternate hypothesis._

Qn: A fitness company claims that its curated diet plan can reduce the weight of an average human being by at least 5 kgs in a month. If you want to test this claim, what will be the Null and Alternate Hypothesis that you would frame?

- $H_0$: Weight reduced in a month after following the diet plan <= 5 kgs

        $H_A$: Weight reduced in a month after following the diet plan > 5kgs

- $H_0$: Weight reduced in a month after following the diet plan < 5 kgs

        $H_A$: Weight reduced in a month after following the diet plan >= 5kgs

- $H_0$: Weight reduced in a month after following the diet plan >= 5 kgs

        $H_A$: Weight reduced in a month after following the diet plan < 5kgs

- $H_0$: Weight reduced in a month after following the diet plan > 5 kgs

        $H_A$: Weight reduced in a month after following the diet plan <= 5kgs

Ans: C. _Correct! The Null Hypothesis is always the status quo or the claim that you want to test. In this case, the claim that you want to test is whether the diet plan indeed reduces the weight by at least 5 kgs or not, so that becomes your Null Hypothesis. The negation of that, in turn, becomes the Alternate Hypothesis._

_Another thing to note here is that the general convention while framing a null and alternate hypothesis is that the null hypothesis should always contain the equality signs (i.e. >=, <=, or =). And the alternate hypothesis should contain the inequality signs (i.e. >, <, or ≠). This is a general convention that should be followed and is the very reason why option D is incorrect even though it doesn't look very different from this one._

Qn: Suppose you're the CEO of a particular company and you have been contacted about the average wages of men and women working on the same post to be unequal. Now, your company has a lesser number of female employees so without the need for sampling, you found out their average salary to be ₹60,000. For men, on the other hand, you need to estimate the population mean (μ) using a sample. Now using hypothesis testing, you need to find out whether the claim that the salaries of men and women are unequal. What will be the null and alternate hypothesis that you frame?

- $H_0:\mu=60,000;\ H_A:\mu\ne60,000$

- $H_0:\mu\ne60,000;\ H_A:\mu=60,000$

- $H_0:\mu\le60,000;\ H_A:\mu>60,000$

- $H_0:\mu\ge60,000;\ H_A:\mu<60,000$

Ans: A. *Correct! If the average salaries of men and women are equal, you don't need to take any action. So you frame the null hypothesis to be the status quo, i.e. the salaries are indeed equal.*

*Another thing to note here is that since you're testing the claim that their salaries are unequal, the null hypothesis should be $\mu\ne60,000$ but since you don't use an inequality sign while framing the null hypothesis conventionally, you go with the null hypothesis being $\mu=60,000$.*

Qn: Goodyear claims that each of its tires can travel more than 7500 miles on average before they need any replacement.

Assuming that the average travel distance is given by μ, what would be the null and the alternate hypothesis in this case?

- $H_0: \mu>7500\ miles\ and\ H_1: \mu \le 7500\ miles$

- $H_0: \mu \ge 7500\ miles\ and\ H_1: \mu < 7500\ miles$

- $H_0: \mu < 7500\ miles\ and\ H_1: \mu \ge 7500\ miles$

- $H_0: \mu \le 7500\ miles\ and\ H_1: \mu > 7500\ miles$

Ans: B. *The initial claim or the status quo is that the tyres can travel more than 7500 miles.  Hence, $H_0: \mu < 7500\ miles$.*

*The action needs to be taken if the null hypothesis fails, i.e. $H_1: \mu \ge 7500\ miles$, hence this becomes the alternative hypothesis.*

*While writing the sign, the null hypothesis is always formulated by either = or ≤ or ≥ whereas the alternate hypothesis is formulated by $\ne or > or <$.*

To summarize this, you cannot decide the status quo or formulate the null hypothesis from the claim statement, you need to take care of signs in writing the null hypothesis. Null Hypothesis never contains $\ne or > or <$ signs. It always has to be formulated using $= or \le or \ge$ signs.
