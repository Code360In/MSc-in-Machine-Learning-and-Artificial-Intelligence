# Properties of Sampling Distributions

We mentioned that sampling distribution has some interesting properties that will later help you estimate the error in your samples. Let’s finally see what these properties are in detail.

#### Standard Deviation of Sampling Distributions

Qn: So, we have these two graphs, which give us the sampling distribution for n = 5 and n = 10. As Akshay said, the one with n = 10 is thinner than the one with n = 5. What does this imply about the standard deviation of the two graphs?

- Standard deviation of first distribution (n=5) > Standard deviation of second distribution (n=20)

- Standard deviation of 1st distribution (n=5) < Standard deviation of 2nd distribution (n=20)

- Standard deviation of 1st distribution (n=5) = Standard deviation of 2nd distribution (n=20)

- Can't say based on this information

Ans: A. *Between any two given graphs, the graph that is narrower always has a lower standard deviation. This will happen because, for the narrow graph, most of its values are concentrated around the centre, which would lead to a low sum of squared errors. Hence, the standard deviation of the first distribution > standard deviation of the second distribution.*

You saw that when you take a large number of samples, the distribution formed using the sample means, i.e., the sampling distribution, closely follows normal distribution. Also, as you keep on increasing the sample size, the distribution also keeps getting thinner implying that the standard deviation (also known as the **standard error** for sampling distribution) of this distribution is decreasing.

Standard error for different sample sizes

Moreover, as you keep increasing the sample size, the curve tends to become perfectly normal. In fact, at sample sizes 30 or greater, it actually becomes close to a perfectly normal distribution. And if you check the last graph, i.e., the distribution for sample size equal to 30, you can see that it's mid-point, i.e., the mean is quite close to the population mean which is 35.

This is the first important property of the sampling distribution of the mean, i.e.,

**Sampling distribution’s mean $(\mu_{\bar{X}})$ = Population mean $(\mu)$**

There is another important property regarding the standard deviation as well (the intricacies and derivation for which is not necessary). This property states that:

**Sampling distribution’s standard deviation (Standard error) = $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$**

Here σ is the population’s standard deviation and n is the sample size.

The derivation of the formula for sampling distribution’s standard error is beyond the scope of the module. If you are interested in reading more about it, please go through this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error).

#### Standard Error

Qn: Standard error (S.E.) is

- The standard deviation of the population.

- The standard deviation of the sample.

- The standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

Ans: C. *The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is known as standard error.*

Qn: As you increase the sample size, the standard error, i.e., the standard deviation of the sampling distribution ______.

- Increases

- Decreases

- Remains the same

- Sample size does not affect the standard deviation

Ans: B. *When you increase the sample size, the standard deviation decreases. It can also be seen from the formula of standard error which is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. Hence, as 'n' increases, the standard error will decrease.*

You just learnt about two new findings from the sampling distribution about the mean and the standard deviation. Now you're well equipped to finally learn about perhaps the most important topic of this module, i.e., the central limit theorem.
