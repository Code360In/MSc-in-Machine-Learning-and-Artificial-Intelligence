# Central Limit Theorem

In the last segment, you understood the property of sampling distributions, specifically with reference to the shape of the distribution. Basically, the property states that for n >= 30, the sampling distributions become normally distributed. Let's recall all the three properties of sampling distributions that you have learnt so far.

So, the central limit theorem says that the following properties hold true for any kind of data, provided the number of samples is high:

1. Sampling distribution’s mean $(\mu_{\bar{X}})$ = Population mean $(\mu)$
2. Sampling distribution’s standard deviation (Standard Error) = $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$
3. For n > 30, the sampling distribution becomes normally distributed. This particular property of sampling distribution is called the **central limit theorem** or **CLT**.

Now let us see the Central Limit Theorem in action using a small visualization available online.

You can test this theorem by using custom-built distributions or any available distribution by going to the following [link](http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/index.html). In the next segment, you will learn about one of the primary applications of Central Limit Theorem which is Interval Estimation.
