# Uses of Sampling in Marketing Campaigns

(**Note**: In this segment, a basic understanding of A/B testing is required, for which you can use the following [link](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/ab-testing/).  You'll learn about A/B testing in particular and hypothesis testing in general in the upcoming module.)

Now, let’s go through the second use case, i.e. the use of sampling in marketing campaigns, for measuring campaign efficacy.

So, say you are an e-commerce company that operates through an app/site. Broadly, there are six common types of problems you would run into:

As you saw in the video, each of these six situations needs to be handled differently.

Let’s pick one of these cases where the user, apparently, opened the app and browsed but didn’t shop. How would you coax such a user to use the app again and actually shop? Let’s see.

So basically, there are four different courses of action that you could take in order to get the user to use your app/site:

Which one of these should you select? Is the strategy of giving a 20% discount more effective than the one in which you give only a 10% discount? Do you even need to give a discount? Is a reminder enough? Will the reminder even work, or will people just return to the app/site themselves after some time?

To be able to answer all these questions, you would need to do an A/B testing. Basically, you would divide your current customer base into four groups, say, group A, group B, group C, and group D. Then, each of the groups would be subjected to one of the above strategies. For example, group A would get a 20% discount coupon, group C would get an app reminder, etc. Then, when you got the data for these sample groups, you could use the concepts of hypothesis testing and sampling to answer the questions given above.

Again, you could use stratified sampling here. But how would you do that? Well, first of all, you’d need to break up your population into various small segments on the basis of factors such as the acquisition channel, the frequency of shopping, the payment mode generally used, etc.

Once you broke your population into microsegments this way, you could then get sample information for each segment. Remember that the reason for making these divisions would be to ensure that the sample represents the population closely.

Finally, once you made these probably unbiased divisions, you would have your sample. And, once you got the sample, you could perform A/B testing.

Ujjyaini will walk you through another use case of sampling, i.e., pilot testing in the next segment.
