Qn: Suppose you want to take a sample of paracetamol tablets. You know that around 20% of them have a very high level of paracetamol, the remaining have moderate to low levels of paracetamol. Which sampling should you perform in order to have close to an unbiased sample?

- Random sampling

- Stratified sampling

- Volunteer Sampling

- Opportunity Sampling

Ans: B. *As most of the tablets have low to moderate levels of paracetamol and a very small number of them have high paracetamol, it makes more sense to perform stratified sampling wherein you'll sample the batch with high paracetamol levels and moderate-to-low paracetamol levels separately. Although this is a quality control problem where random sampling is preferred, you know that there are two batches containing different paracetamol levels, and one of them constitutes just 20% of the tablets, it makes more sense to perform stratified sampling.*
