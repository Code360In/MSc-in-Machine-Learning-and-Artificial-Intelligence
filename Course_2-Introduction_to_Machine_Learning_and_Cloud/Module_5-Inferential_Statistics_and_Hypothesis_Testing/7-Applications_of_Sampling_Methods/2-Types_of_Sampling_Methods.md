# Types of Sampling Methods

So, as you saw in the last section, it is important to understand the process of sample data collection. For this, you will need to explore the various sampling methods.

Generally, these sampling methods are categorised into four types. Let’s listen to Ujjyaini as she explains what these four types are and how and when they are used.

As you just learnt, there are four types of sampling methods/techniques, as depicted by the following image

These four types of sampling methods are —

1. **Random Sampling**: In this method, people are just selected randomly. This is similar to pulling names out of a hat.

Example: Suppose you want to find out the average internet usage per person in India. You just put the names of all the Indians in a hat, pull, say, 100 names out, and then calculate the average of these 100 Indians.

2. **Stratified Sampling:** Here, people are divided into subgroups and then selected randomly. But this is done in such a way that the final sample has the same proportions of these subgroups as does the population.

**Example**: Again, suppose you want to find out the average internet usage per person in India. Note that 70% of Indians live in rural areas, and 30% live in urban areas. So, you would put the names of all the rural Indians in hat A and the names of all the urban Indians in hat B. Then, you’d pull 70 names out of hat A and 30 names out of hat B. Now, again you’d have a sample of 100 Indians, but this time, your sample would be more representative of the population as its rural and urban proportions would be the same as that of the population.

3. **Volunteer Sampling**: Here, people who want to volunteer for any given survey form your sample.

**Example**: Suppose that once more, you want to find out the average internet usage per person in India. You could have everyone answer an online survey, which asks them how often/much they use the internet. You could ask the same question through a telephonic survey.

As you can see through this example, the good thing about this type of sampling is that it looks unbiased and random because the person who will take part in the survey is selected at random through the medium (internet, telephone) itself. There is no human interference. However, the medium will also bring in some bias. For example, an internet survey is more likely to have people with a high internet usage, whereas a telephone survey is a little more likely to have a balanced representation of heavy internet users and people who use the internet infrequently.

4. **Opportunity Sampling**: In this method, people around the surveyor form their sample space.

**Example**: This time, when you want to find out the average internet usage per person in India, you just ask 100 people around you about their internet usage.

Clearly, this sampling method has the potential to become extremely biased. The only good thing here, probably, is that this is a relatively convenient sampling method.

In the next segment, you will learn about the different use cases of sampling. Apart from that, you'll dive deeper into one particular use case, i.e. market research.
