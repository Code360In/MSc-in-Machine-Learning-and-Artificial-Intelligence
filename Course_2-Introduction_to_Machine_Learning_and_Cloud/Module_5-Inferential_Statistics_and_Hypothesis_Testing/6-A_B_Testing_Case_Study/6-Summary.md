# Summary

In this session, you learnt about decision errors and A/B testing. You also went through a case study for an e-commerce company that involved performing exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing and A/B testing. Letâ€™s now do a quick revision of all the important points that were covered in this session.

In this session, you were introduced to A/B testing, wherein you learnt the following:

- A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject's response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.

- When we run a multivariate test, it means that we are changing multiple factors to test the change in a metric.

The steps to conduct an A/B test are as follows:

- Defining the objective

- Defining the KPIs

- Identifying the drivers for the KPIs

- Prioritising the driver that you want to test

- Segmenting the population

- Interpreting the results

Finally, you conducted a case study on an e-commerce company, wherein you established that the organisation has a poor record in delivery and performed a hypothesis test to prove that its late delivery complaint percentage is greater than the industry average of 6%. Finally, an A/B test was conducted to check whether the newly built algorithm had decreased the percentage of late delivery reviews not.
