# Hypothesis Testing in Python

You can easily do hypothesis testing in Python by using **stats** from **Scipy** library. In the case study, we have used a number of python libraries to demonstrate the different statistical tests. You can quickly refer to this video to get a quick summary of all the important statistical tests on python.

You will not be tested on this segment. However these codes can help you solve hypothesis tests directly and calculate the p-value without having mathematically perform the calculations. In the next segment, you will look at a case study and perform a real life example of AB testing.
