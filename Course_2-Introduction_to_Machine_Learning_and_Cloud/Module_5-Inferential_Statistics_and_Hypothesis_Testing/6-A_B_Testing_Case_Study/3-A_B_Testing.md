# A/B Testing

Until now, you gained insight into the theoretical aspect of hypothesis testing. In this segment, we will delve into its practical relevance in the industry.

Let’s now learn from Ankit Jain about a process that is widely used in digital and online companies — **A/B testing.**

While developing an e-commerce website, there could be different opinions about the choices of various elements, such as the shape of buttons, the text on the call-to-action buttons, the colour of various UI elements, the copy on the website, or numerous other such things.

Often, the choice of these elements is very subjective and is difficult to predict which option would perform better. To resolve such conflicts, you can use A/B testing. **A/B testing** provides a way for you to test two different versions of the same element and see which one performs better. You can read more about A/B testing from this **[link](https://www.optimizely.com/ab-testing/)**.

You can see a few more case studies and applications of A/B testing in the real world **[here](https://blog.optimizely.com/2015/06/04/ecommerce-conversion-optimization-case-studies/)**.

Now, let’s learn how an A/B test is conducted within an organization. You can read more about A/B testing from this [link](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/ab-testing/).

The steps to conducting an A/B test are as follows:

- Defining the objective

- Defining the KPIs

    **Note**: KPI stands for ‘Key Performance Indicator’. KPIs are performance indicators that are used to evaluate how effectively an organization is in achieving its key business objectives.

- Identifying the drivers for the KPIs

- Prioritizing the driver that you want to test

- Segmenting the population

- Interpreting the results

In the next video, you will understand these steps in detail from Ankit.
