# Introduction

Welcome to this module on Statistics.

This module will be more mathematical and focus on interpreting the summary statistics of the data by considering only a sample of that data. Now, statistics can be a difficult topic to understand and is a highly underrated field to acquire proficiency in; that only a few data scientists can effectively apply it in real-life scenarios. Therefore, it is important that you gain a proper understanding of statistics if you want to excel in the field of data science or data analysis. Now, let’s hear from Ankit Agarwal as he explains the agenda for this module.

When talking about numbers, you must have already guessed that this means learning complex formulas, banging your head to get the right answers and difficult calculations. Not really! You need to keep the following three points in mind before proceeding to the subsequent segments:

- Do **NOT** memorise any formula.

- Memorise formulae only after you have understood them.

- This module is mathematically heavy, especially the part of the statistical tests. The objective is to **understand which tests can be applied in which scenarios**. A few solved examples have been provided to help you understand the application of the statistical tests.

As Ankit explained in the video, most people jump directly into machine learning algorithms without understanding the importance of statistics. In fact, many machine learning algorithms are based on statistics, and hence, it is important that you understand these derivations, else you will just be blindly applying these models.

## In this module

We will explore three key aspects of statistics:

- Probability and its distributions

- Hypothesis testing

- A/B testing

In the next video, Ankit will give a small introduction to this module.

**VIDEO**

To summarise what you learnt in this video, inferential statistics is used to make an inference about a population based on a sample. Suppose you want to calculate the average salary of software engineers in India. According to Evans Data Corporation, a market research company, there are approximately **2.75 million** software engineers in India. It is impossible to determine the salary of each software engineer and, thereby, calculate the average. So, in this case, you need to consider a sample of **2,000** employed software engineers, calculate their average salary and draw a conclusion to estimate the average salary of all the software engineers in India.

**Note:** In case you are confused about a population versus a sample, in the above example, the 2.75 million software engineers represent the population, and the selected 2,000 employees represent a sample that is taken from that population. In other words, a population is the complete set of data, whereas a sample is a subset of the population. In most cases, the data that you have is the sample data and hence, inferential statistics and hypothesis testing play a crucial role in making the correct inference about the population.

Now, let’s understand the concept of hypothesis testing. In simple terms, hypothesis testing allows you to prove or disprove any hypothesis. For example, let’s consider the statement ‘You tend to score higher marks in **Maths** than in **History**’. You can use hypothesis testing to prove whether this statement is true or not. As explained in the previous video, you can extend the example that you considered in inferential statistics (about software engineers) to test whether the following statements are true or not.

- ‘The salary of software engineers is more than that of data scientists.’

- ‘The salary of software engineers is ₹10 lakh.’

- ‘The salary of software engineers is more than ₹10 lakh.’

## In this session

You will learn about the following concepts:

- Probability and its types

- Expected value and variance

- Discrete probability distributions

- Continuous probability distributions

#### Introduction

Qn: Suppose you want to determine whether the statement ‘The salary of data scientists is greater than that of software engineers’ is true or not. Which of the following aspects of statistics will help you solve this problem?

(**Note**: More than one option may be correct.)

- Inferential statistics

- Hypothesis testing

Ans: Both.

- *In order to estimate the average salary of both software engineers and data scientists, you will need to use inferential statistics. Your first step is take a sample of  software engineers and data scientists and estimate their average salaries using inferential statistics.*

- *Once we have estimated the average salaries of software engineers and data scientists, Hypothesis testing can be used to determine whether the statement ‘The salary of data scientists is more than that of software engineers’ is true or not.*
