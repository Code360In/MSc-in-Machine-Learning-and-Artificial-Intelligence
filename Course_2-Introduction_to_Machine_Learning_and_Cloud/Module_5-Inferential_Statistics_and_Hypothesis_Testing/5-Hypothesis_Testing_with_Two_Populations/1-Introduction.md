# Introduction

In the previous session, you learnt how to conduct hypothesis tests for situations involving a **single population mean or single population proportion**. You learnt how to formulate the hypotheses and then make a decision through the p-value method. These involved solving problems, such as comparing a population parameter to a given value, for example, checking whether the mean customer expenditure is greater than 170 Rs.

In this session, you will learn how to conduct hypothesis testing involving **two populations.**

## In this session

You will learn how hypothesis testing is used in the industry and how the basic concepts learnt in the previous session form an important foundation of useful industry concepts such as A/B testing.

We will cover the following topics in this session:

- Comparing means with known variance and unknown variance (Two-sample mean test)

- Comparing proportions (Two-sample proportion test)

- Testing matched samples

You will realise that the process remains the same. You collect two samples instead of one. With this, define the hypothesis and the level of significance, calculate the test statistic and conclude the test based on the p-value.
