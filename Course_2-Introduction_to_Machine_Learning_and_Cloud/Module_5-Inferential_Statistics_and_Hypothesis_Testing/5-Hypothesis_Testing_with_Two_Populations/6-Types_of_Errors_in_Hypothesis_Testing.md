# Types of Errors in Hypothesis Testing

Now that you have understood the different scenarios and the steps involved in framing and evaluating a hypothesis, let’s go ahead and look at some of the nuances involved in hypothesis testing. When you have finally made a decision after evaluating your hypothesis, there are two main errors that you can commit. Let’s hear from Amit as he explains what these errors are.

So you looked at the following table and saw there are essentially two types of errors that you can commit.

The two errors are:

1. α is the acceptable probability of making a Type I error (also called the significance level). Alternatively, (1 – α) is called the confidence level (Recall that you had learnt about confidence level in your inferential statistics module.). This occurs when your null hypothesis is actually true but you reject it.
2. β is the probability of making a Type II error. Alternatively, (1 – β) is called the power of the test. This occurs when your alternate hypothesis is true but you still fail to reject your null hypothesis.

Now let’s take a look at the business implications of the type-I error. In this case, you’re rejecting your null hypothesis even if it’s true, i.e., you’re accepting the alternate hypothesis and taking an action. But since this action requires time, money, and other resources, you cannot afford to make a mistake here very often which is why managers are more concerned with the type-I error.

#### Type of Error

Qn: Let’s take the last example you looked at. Recall that in the last segment, you took the decision to launch the loyalty card. But after the launch, you found out that the mean purchase of the customers after the card was launched was ₹115 which is less than ₹120. What kind of error did you commit in this case?

- Type-I error

- Type-II error

- No error was committed

Ans: A. *In this case, even though your null hypothesis was true, i.e., the average spend of customers is less than or equal to 120, you had decided to reject your null hypothesis and launch the loyalty card. But since, after the launch, the mean purchase came out to be ₹115 which is less than ₹120, you committed a Type-I error.*

#### Confidence Level

Qn: For the supermarket loyalty card example, the probability of committing a type-I error was 0.05. This means that the confidence level was _____.

- 5%

- 50%

- 90%

- 95%

Ans: D. *The probability of committing a type-I error is given by α. Hence, in this case, α is equal to 0.05. Recall that the confidence level, in turn, is given by (1 - α). Hence, the confidence level becomes (1 - 0.05) = 0.95, i.e., 95%.*

## Comprehension

The ideal water used in concrete mixing should not have more than 200 mg/litre of solid organic content on average. So, before any construction work begins, the concerned engineers test samples of water from different water sources to select an appropriate water source, or they use filtered water.

The hypotheses for this test are:  

H0: Average organic  content ≤ 200 (Water is fit for concrete mixing)

Ha: Average organic content > 200 (Water is unfit for concrete mixing)

#### Decision Errors

Qn: Which of the following is a type-I error?

- The hypothesis test declares the water unfit for construction when, in fact, it is fit.

- The hypothesis test declares the water unfit for construction when it is actually unfit.

- The hypothesis test declares the water fit for construction when it is actually fit.

- The hypothesis test declares the water fit for construction when, in fact, it isn't fit.

Ans: A. *In a type-I error, the Ho is correct, but it is rejected.  Hence, if we declare the water unfit, we are rejecting the null hypothesis. But since the water is actually fit, the rejection of the null hypothesis leads to a type-1 error.*

Qn: Which of the following is a type-II error?

- The hypothesis test declares the water unfit for construction, and it actually is not fit.

- The hypothesis test declares the water fit for construction when, in fact, it is not fit.

- The hypothesis test declares the water unfit for construction when, in fact, it is fit.

- The hypothesis test declares the water fit for construction, and it actually is fit.

Ans: B. *In a type-2 error, the H0 is incorrect. Thus, if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we are declaring the water fit for construction. But the water is actually unfit for construction, and hence, this is a type-2 error.*

In the next segment, we will summarise everything that we have learned in this session.
