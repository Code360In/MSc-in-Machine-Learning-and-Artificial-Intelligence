# What is Machine Learning?

Let’s start our discussion by understanding what machine learning is. In this video, the professor will discuss a few applications of machine learning that we may come across in our daily lives.

**VIDEO**

In this video, you saw a few applications of machine learning. In particular, fraudulent transaction detection is a quite common application of machine learning in the finance industry. It enables banks to detect suspicious transactions by considering various factors such as vendor information, time of the transaction and customer history.

You also saw how various eCommerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra and streaming platforms like YouTube and Netflix use machine learning to provide useful recommendations.

**Example**

Let’s consider a music streaming platform to understand the recommendation process better. The algorithms on these platforms ensure that the most likely song is suggested based on your preferences and taste.

Well, to perform this, they are not expected to hire an army of engineers to code instructions in the application step by step to generate these recommendations. Instead,

1. They train their systems or models based on a set of features, such as the song’s tempo, lyrics and pitch.
2. Furthermore, they train a separate model to identify behavioural patterns of various users, that is, they infer that if user A liked songs x, y and z and user B liked songs x and y, user B might also like song z. Here, these programs use specific user-related information such as the user’s past song choices, favourite songs and preferred genre.

They combine the outputs of these two models to provide better recommendations to their users. In this way, by analysing various factors such as a song’s tempo and lyrics and the user’s past listening pattern, companies such as Spotify build machine learning models, that is, they train their systems to produce more valuable recommendations.

#### Machine Learning

Qn: Considering features such as speed, acceleration and time, a student came up with the following formula to calculate the distance travelled by car.

s = ut + (1/2)at2

He wrote a program to implement the same. Now, is this a machine learning model?

Ans: This is not a machine learning model. In the same scenario, let’s say the student performs a few trials and provides the data obtained during those trials to the model. If the model now tries to come up with the distance output itself given the necessary parameters, then it can be considered to be machine learning.
