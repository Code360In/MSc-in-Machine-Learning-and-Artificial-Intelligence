<p>Let’s summarize what you have learnt so far in the session.</p>
<p>You began with understanding what machine learning is all about by looking at various examples from different domains, such as product recommendations and detecting fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>Then, using the example of a simple chatbot, you understood that applications of artificial intelligence could be as simple as defining a set of rules and asking the machine to respond accordingly or as complex as an expert system which behaves like a human. The term “artificial intelligence” encompasses both machine learning and deep learning.</p>

<p>After this, you understood the role of the cloud in the field of machine learning by looking at a simple scenario where the New York Times wants to analyse their new articles. In this case, the New York Times needed to scale up its resources, but that would have been too expensive. Instead, the cloud made the whole process hassle-free, wherein you can rent resources such as storage and computing power and monitor them over the internet.</p>

<p>Having understood why knowledge of cloud technologies is essential, you began to understand why it is crucial to learn how a distributed system works when performing machine learning on a vast amount of data, that is, big data applications.</p>
<p>In the subsequent parts of the session, you went a little further into the domain of machine learning. You started to understand the two broad categories: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning, as the name suggests, is a type of learning in which you have data that clearly specifies the input and corresponding output. On the other hand, in unsupervised learning, there is no clearly defined input and output. You try to form insights from the data at your data.</p>
<p>After understanding this, you looked at a few important classes of machine learning algorithms under  <strong>supervised and unsupervised learning</strong>.</p>

<p>Under supervised learning, you learnt about regression and classification algorithms. You understood that if you are looking to predict a continuous value, you use a regression algorithm. On the other hand, if you are looking to predict a discrete value, you use a classification algorithm.</p>
<p>Similarly, you also learnt about clustering and rule mining algorithms, which fall under the unsupervised type of learning. These two classes of algorithms are responsible for uncovering interesting patterns in data.</p>
<p>With this, we come to the end of the session. In the next session, you will learn about the machine learning pipeline, which is essential to understanding how to build a machine learning product at scale. You will also learn how to implement the apriori algorithm, an association rule mining algorithm, using which you can obtain interesting insights from data.</p>
