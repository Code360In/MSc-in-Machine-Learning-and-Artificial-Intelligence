# Machine Learning and Big Data

Before diving into big data, let’s understand what data and big data mean exactly.

As per Wikipedia, data refers to the “fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing”. Big data has the same definition, with the only difference being that it is huge in size. Big data is not only massive, but it also has the potential to grow exponentially for an indefinite period.

Let’s look at how big data relates to machine learning in our next video.

You learnt about frameworks such as MapReduce and Hadoop filesystem, which are used to store and process big data. As you move along the course, you will learn about these frameworks and how they help analyse big data.

Today, almost all leading companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook store and process big data to gain entirely new types of insights. Looking at the potential benefits of storing and processing big data, more organizations have started storing and processing big data for better decision-making.

In the next video, our industry expert Sourabh Mukherjee will discuss the volume of data that companies such as Facebook and Google deal with. You will also learn about some of the major sources of big data.

You learnt that size is not the only criterion for defining big data. Big data can also be characterized in terms of the speed at which the data arrives and its variety. You also learnt about various examples of big data sources.

#### Machine Learning and Big Data

Qn:
What has motivated developers to develop distributed systems in recent times? (Multiple options may be correct.)

Ans:

- Availability of cheap CPUs and large amounts of memory - High-power supercomputers were available before distributed systems became popular. The major limitation of supercomputers is that they are neither scalable nor flexible. However, they are preferred for specialised tasks such as weather forecasting.
- Advancements in the software industry - One of the major reasons for the development of distributed computing is the advancement of the software industry, which made it possible for a cluster to work together as a single machine.
- Availability of cheap and reliable communications channels - One of the major reasons for the development of distributed computing is the advancement of communications networks, which made it possible to exchange large amounts of data among machines.
