In summary, a lot of computational power is required to train and build models; in other words, you need powerful machines or servers to build solutions. Cloud makes it possible to store terabytes of data generated in various forms such as weblogs and data from your devices as well as process all of it.

Towards the end of the video, you looked at one of the solutions offered by Google to convert speech to text. You can read more about it  [here.](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/reference/rest/?apix=true)
