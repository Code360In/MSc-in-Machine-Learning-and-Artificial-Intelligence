# Module Overview

Welcome to this module on Introduction to Machine learning!

So far in this program, you have learnt the basics of Python and gained an understanding of exploratory data analysis, which you will use extensively throughout the program.  

## In this module

You will start by understanding machine learning and its role in everyday life, after which you will understand the role of cloud and big data within the context of machine learning at scale.

You will learn about the broad classifications under machine learning and obtain a broad overview of specific algorithms, such as regression, classification and clustering.

Once you have a broad idea of machine learning algorithms, you will begin to understand the process and different steps involved in putting any machine learning model into production, which is known as the  **machine learning pipeline**.

Algorithm application is a crucial part of the whole machine learning pipeline, but there are other essential parts as well, such as how you get data, where you store the data, and how the solution reaches the end-user. By the end of the session, you will understand all these parts of the machine learning pipeline.

Also, you will learn how to implement one of the basic algorithms, called the apriori algorithm, which falls under the association rule mining category of algorithms. Using the apriori algorithm, you will understand how to extract insights or find relationships in the data.

## In this session

You will broadly learn about the following topics:

- What is Machine Learning?
- Difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Applications of Machine Learning
- Machine learning and Cloud
- Machine learning and Big data
- Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised learning algorithms
- Unsupervised learning algorithms
