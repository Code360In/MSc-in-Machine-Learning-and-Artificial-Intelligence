# Introduction

In the previous session, you learnt about unsupervised learning algorithms. You also learnt about association rule mining and got an understanding of the Apriori algorithm.

## In this session

You will learn about the Apriori algorithm in detail. This session will help you understand the theoretical aspects of the algorithm and help you sequentially understand the process behind it. Let’s start with a quick introduction video by our industry expert, Sajan.
