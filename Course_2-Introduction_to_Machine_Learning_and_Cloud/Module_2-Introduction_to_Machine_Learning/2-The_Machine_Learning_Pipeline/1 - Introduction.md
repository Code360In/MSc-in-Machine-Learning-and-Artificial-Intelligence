Like Ankit mentioned, there are many steps involved in building an end-to-end machine learning model. Applying the algorithm is one of the crucial steps of the entire machine learning pipeline, but there are other essential parts as well, such as how you get the data, where you store the data and how to get your solution to the end-user. By the end of this session, you will have a broad understanding of the different steps involved in building a machine learning pipeline.
