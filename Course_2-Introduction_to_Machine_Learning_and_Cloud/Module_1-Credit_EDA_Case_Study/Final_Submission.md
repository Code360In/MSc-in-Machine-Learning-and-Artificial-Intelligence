# Final Submission

For submissions obtained within 1 week of the deadline, there will be a 30% penalty. Submissions beyond 1 week of the deadline will be provided only feedback and score zero marks (100% penalty).

You must go through these guidelines-

1. Make sure you have not made any changes to the original dataset provided to you. Your Python code should work on the dataset given to you as part of the problem statement. You are not allowed to make modifications in data set using excel and then use it in your Python code. Entire data processing must be done in Python only. During grading we will be running your code on the dataset provided by us, in case your code gives errors with that, then marks will be deducted accordingly.

2. All penalties are automatically applied by the system based on time of submission. Hence, submissions that are late, even by a second, will attract penalties.

For e.g.- If the deadline is 2nd August 2019, 11:59:00 PM IST, the submissions at 2nd August 2019, 11:59:01 PM IST will attract a penalty of 30%. Hence we recommend that assignments are submitted at least 30 minutes before the deadline to avoid any last minute issues.

Also, note the all the deadlines are in IST (UTC +5.5), hence, if you are in a different time zone, then your deadline may vary according to local time. For eg - If you are in London and following BST (British Summer Time) which is UTC +1 then deadline for you in local time would be 7:29:00 PM BST when the deadline in India is 11:59:00 PM IST.

3. Make sure you click “Submit for Grading” only if you are 100% sure, else you must just upload your file and leave it there. It will be automatically submitted before the deadline. If you click “Submit for grading” after uploading the file, under no circumstance you will be allowed to resubmit or change your upload.

Here are the steps that you must follow during submitting any assignment-

1. Collect all the files (if there are multiple files) and compress them together.

2. Try to upload this compressed file latest by 11:30 PM

3. Download your submission and check that you have included all the required files.

4. Check that none of the files or the zip is corrupt. If it is found to be corrupt during grading, you will NOT be allowed to re-submit.

5. If you are 100% sure that you will not need to make any more changes in the assignment, click “Submit for Grading”, else, just let it be. Unless you remove it, it will be automatically submitted at the upcoming deadline.
