# Problem Statement

Welcome to the session on '**Linear Regression - CaseStudy**'.

So far, we have discussed the basics of linear regression and understood different steps involved in model building.

1.  Data Cleaning and Data Preprocessing activities
2.  Performing EDA on the dataset to gain insights for model building
3.  Creating a basic linear regression model
4.  Using feature selection techniques to improvise the model
5.  Testing the model on Unseen data 

You learned how to build models locally using the sklearn library and also learnt how to implement the same using pyspark. In this case study, you will learn how to solve a practical problem using the concepts you have learnt so far.

Let's first understand the problem statement from Jaidev.

The dataset belongs to New York City taxi fares. The objective of this case study is to build a **pricing model** wherein, given a  set of attributes such as date-time, coordinates for pickup and drop off, the fare is predicted for that particular ride. In this case study, we will begin by dealing with the different outliers and creating a Linear Regression model that computes the best possible r2 score.
