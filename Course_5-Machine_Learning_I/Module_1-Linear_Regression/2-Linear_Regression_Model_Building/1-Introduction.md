# Introduction

Welcome to the session on '**Linear Regression - Model Building**'. So far, we have discussed the basics of linear regression. Now, let's move on to building linear regression models.

## In this Session

You will learn about the generic steps that are required to build a linear regression model. You will first read and visualise the dataset. Then you will learn how to build a linear model using two different libraries - **statsmodels** and **SKLearn**. You will also learn some of the key feature selection methods involved in selecting relevant features for model building. Feature selection, just like EDA, is an important step for model building, and you will learn about it in detail in this session.

But before you move onto the practical implementation of linear regression, let's do a quick recap of what you have learnt so far. You first understood the importance of linear models and then started an in-depth study of the most common linear model used in practice - Linear Regression. You started by understanding the internals of the algorithm, and also looked at some of the important assumptions involved in building a linear regression model. Towards the latter part of the session, you saw the basic implementation of linear regression using the numpy library. Finally, towards the end of the session, you saw some of the metrics to evaluate the performance of a model.

**Important Note**

-   As you move along this session you will see Jaidev using matplotlib and seaborn library frequently for visualization. So, it is highly recommended to spend some time revising the preparatory content on python libraries and data visualization. 
    
-   There are notebooks provided along with the session. It is recommended to keep the notebook opened while going through the videos. There are few exercises provided after each topic and you may need to answer the questions based on that coding exercise.
