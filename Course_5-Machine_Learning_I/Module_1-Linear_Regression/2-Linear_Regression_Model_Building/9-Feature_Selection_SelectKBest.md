# Feature Selection - SelectKBest

In this segment, you will learn about the selectKbest feature estimator of sklearn used for feature selection. Let’s understand more about this in our next video.

**VIDEO**

SelectKBest is used in finding the correlation between the set of input features and the output feature, and based on this correlation it chooses all the set of features for which the correlation is the highest. Note that you use f-regression as a parameter while using SelectKbest for feature selection in a regression problem. You can read more about f_regression [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_regression.html#sklearn.feature_selection.f_regression).

Ans: 

In the next segment, you will learn about recursive feature elimination, which is another method of performing feature selection.
