# Summary

Let’s quickly summarize what you have learnt so far in this session. See the following video for the summary.

To summarise

-   Linear regression models can be classified into two types depending upon the number of independent variables: 
    
    -   **Simple linear regression**: This is used when the number of independent variables is 1.
        
    -   **Multiple linear regression**: This is used when the number of independent variables is more than 1.
        
-   The equation of the best fit regression line $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X$ can be found by minimising the cost function RSS in this case by using the ordinary least squares method.
    
-   The assumptions of linear regression
    
    -   Linear independence
        
    -   Normality of errors
        
    -   Exogeneity - Errors must have a mean of zero
        
-   The strength of a linear regression model is mainly explained by $R_2$, where $R^2 = 1 - (RSS/TSS)$.
