# Linear Models as Benchmarks

We have learnt about linear regression, which is a classic example of a linear model. In the next video, letâ€™s look at the importance of linear models in general and why they should be the go-to models before performing any analysis.

To summarise, linear models are the simplest models to build and the performance of any non-linear model you build should be better than this linear model. When discussing a model performance, one of the most common references is the bias-variance trade-off. You will understand what it means and what's its significance in the latter part of the module.

#### Regression

Qn: Rohit builds two linear regression models to solve the car pricing problem - model (1) has three features and model (2) has 11 features. Which model is likely to undergo a larger change when a new training dataset is used?

- Model 1

- Model 2

Ans: B. *Model 2 can change its 11 coefficients (and the constant term) to fit the new training data.*

#### Simplicity and Complexity

Qn: The reason simpler models are considered better than complex models are (mark all the correct options):

- Simpler models are generic, i.e., they apply to a wider range of data.

- Simple models are more interpretable.

- Simpler models require less training data than complex models.

- Simpler models are more robust.

Ans: *All of the above*
