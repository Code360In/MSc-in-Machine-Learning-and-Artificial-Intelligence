# Media Company Case Study

Recall the case of a media company from the business cases that we considered for the application of linear regression; this case is quite similar.

The problem statement is as follows: A digital media company (similar to Voot, Hotstar, Netflix, etc.) had launched a show. Initially, the show got a good response, but then, it started witnessing a decline in viewership. The company wants to figure out what went wrong.

You can download the data set, data dictionary and the IPython Notebook from below:

Let’s see how we can use linear regression to identify the root cause of the decline in viewership.

You looked at the digital media company data set. You understood the various attributes that could have led to a decline in the new show’s viewership. In the next lecture, you will look at the exploratory data analysis of the data set.
