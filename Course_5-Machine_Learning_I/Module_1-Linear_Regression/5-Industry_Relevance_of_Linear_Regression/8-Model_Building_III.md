# Model Building - III

Let's continue the process of model building.

**VIDEO**

In the process of building the model, you checked for multiple variables and then arrived at the variables that best suited the model.

Based on your understanding of the models, answer the following questions:

#### Cricket Match

Qn: A cricket match between Australia and India is taking place over the weekend. Should the producers be worried about losing show viewers to the match?

- Yes

- No

Ans: B. *Cricket matches (featuring India) were found to be insignificant in explaining show viewership. Thus, the cricket match would not impact show viewership.*

Now that you have a model with a fairly high adjusted R-squared, it may seem that the task is done. But you still might be missing out on an important variable. Thus, you need to assess the model. In the following lectures, you will learn some important methods of assessing the model and confirming that the model you arrived at is the best you could have, given the data you have.

#### Character\_A

Qn: Ujjyaini dropped the Character A variable because its coefficient came out to be negative and it was counter to the business understanding that the star presence of Character A boosts viewership. What does this suggest? Would it make sense to rely on data and stop Character A's future appearances to give an additional boost to viewership?

Ans: *Although the data suggests that dropping character A would boost viewership, it is also important to consider the business implications of doing so. As Ujjyaini mentioned in the video, character A is an important character and his/her absence would be counter-intuitive from a business standpoint.*
