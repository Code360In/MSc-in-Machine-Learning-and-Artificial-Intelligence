# Prediction vs Projection

In the last lecture, you learnt when linear regression modelling can be applied.

You will often see the terms 'prediction' and 'projection' being used interchangeably; however, in terms of modelling, these are different applications. Let’s learn the difference between them.

#### Projection

Qn: Which of the following is true in case of projection? (More than one option may be correct.)

- Projection focuses on the identification of variables that are important in explaining the outcome, rather than how good the final outcome is.

- While making a projection, it is assumed that the conditions under which the model was built continue to be the same.

- It is better to get a simple model with lower accuracy than a complex model with high accuracy.

- The accuracy of the final outcome is more important than the identification of the most important driver variables.

Ans: B & D.

- *Forecast assumes that conditions remain the same as they were when the model was built.*

- *While making a projection, the aim is accuracy. Thus, a complex model containing a large number of variables with high accuracy is more valuable than a simple model with lower accuracy.*

In the previous segment, you got a basic idea of interpolation and extrapolation. Let's now learn more about these in detail.

In this segment, you learnt that linear regression can be effectively used for interpolation, but extrapolation may not necessarily be effective/accurate.

In the next segment, you will look at a case study for a media company.
