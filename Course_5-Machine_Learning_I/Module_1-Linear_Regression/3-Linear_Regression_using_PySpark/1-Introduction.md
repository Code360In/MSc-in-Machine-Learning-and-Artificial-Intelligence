# Introduction

Welcome to the session on ‘Simple Linear Regression using PySpark’. 

So far in the first two sessions of the module, you have learnt the basics of linear regression and saw how to build linear models using the scikit-learn library and the stats library. Using the scikit-learn library and the stats library you can build models when the size of the data is small. But what happens when the size of data increases; then you need to resort to Spark to write productionizable codes. Spark ML library makes machine learning scalable and easy and this session aims at teaching you how to build models using PySpark.

## In this Session

In this session, you will first explore the Spark ML API  and understand how to perform basic EDA on a dataset. You will also understand components such as feature transformers, feature estimators, pipelines and their usage while writing your codes in PySpark. After this, you will learn how to build regression and classification models. This section is more focused on giving an intuition of how simple is model building. What’s important before building any machine learning model is getting a sense of what is happening internally and that is something that you will develop as you move along this machine learning course. Then we will continue our implementation of linear regression on the Boston housing dataset using the Spark ML API.

Also so far in the module, you haven’t checked one important aspect of model building which is the performance of the model on an unseen dataset. This is a crucial component in model building because it might be possible the model is performing well on the training dataset but fails to perform on the test dataset.
