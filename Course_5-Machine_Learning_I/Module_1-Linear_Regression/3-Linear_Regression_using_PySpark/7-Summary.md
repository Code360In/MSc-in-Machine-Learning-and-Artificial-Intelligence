# Summary

Let's summarize what you have learnt in this session,

In this session, you first explored the Spark ML API  and understood how to perform basic EDA on a dataset. You also understood components such as feature transformers, feature estimators, pipelines and their usage while writing your codes in PySpark. After this, you learnt how to build regression and classification models. 

Also, you looked at an important aspect of model building which is the performance of the model on an unseen dataset. This is crucial in the model building because it might be possible the model is performing well on the training dataset but fails to perform on the test dataset.
