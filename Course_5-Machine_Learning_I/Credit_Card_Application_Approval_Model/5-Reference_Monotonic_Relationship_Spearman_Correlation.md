# Monotonic Relationship: Spearman Correlation

In the segment on the WOE, you learnt that it is necessary to establish a monotonic relationship. To check for monotonic relationships, you can use the Spearman correlation. Before learning about the Spearman correlation, let's watch the next video to revise the Pearson correlation, which was covered in the module on Linear Regression.

Correlation-based measures check for the overall similarity between objects when their features are highly correlated.

-   **Pearson correlation coefficient**: In the module on Linear Regression, you learnt that the coefficient of determination is represented by R2. This coefficient of determination is nothing but the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient and is represented by r. The Pearson correlation coefficient **evaluates the linear relationship** between two variables.   
     
    
-   **Spearman correlation coefficient**: This evaluates the monotonic relationship between two variables. You can learn more about this correlation from this [link](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient).
    

In the next segment, you will attempt some practice questions to understand the WOE better.
