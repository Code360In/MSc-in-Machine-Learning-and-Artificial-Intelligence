# Introduction

In the previous module, you were introduced to one of the most fundamental machine learning algorithms: **linear regression**. It is an algorithm that is used to predict the values of continuous variables. You learnt about its implementation using the scikit-learn library and the ML library of Spark on the EMR cluster. 

## In this module

You will be introduced to another fundamental machine learning algorithm that is used for classification tasks, logistic regression. The discussion on logistic regression will begin with the basics of the classification problem and gradually build the mathematical concepts involved in logistic regression. Then, you will learn about the different evaluation metrics that help in measuring the performance of a logistic regression model.

Next, you will use pre-existing libraries such as scikit learn in Python and ML library in PySpark to implement logistic regression. The code demonstrations covered in this module will solve two problems: predicting the telecom customer churn and predicting the click-through rates of advertisements. In the next video, let’s hear about the objective of this module from our SME, Jaidev.

## In this session

Before you start building logistic models, it will be helpful to understand the classification problems and the mathematical concepts that will help you solve these problems. So, this session will start there and then build on it. You will learn how to derive the cost function of this algorithm and minimise it. Some segments of this session may be mathematically heavy. So, you are advised to watch them twice to have a better understanding. By the end of this session, you should be able to understand how a logistic regression model works.
