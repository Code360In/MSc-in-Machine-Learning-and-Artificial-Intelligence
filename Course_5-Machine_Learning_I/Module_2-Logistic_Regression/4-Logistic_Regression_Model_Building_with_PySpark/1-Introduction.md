# Introduction

Welcome to the session on '**Logistic Regression - Model Building With PySpark**', wherein we will be discussing a case study on click-through rate.   
   
The objective of this session is to build a model to solve a classification problem using the PySpark ML library. You will also explore certain methodologies and techniques used to build and optimise a model. Carefully note the process of code execution; you will find many small tips and tricks that will help you in the future. 

This case study will be performed on the **Amazon EMR cluster**, and in the later parts of the case study, a higher configuration of the cluster will be used. As you already know, model building is an iterative process. Therefore, in the process, our subject-matter expert Jaidev has trained multiple logistic regression models.

Please note that this training takes a minimum of **2 hours** on the EMR cluster. You are expected to do the model training only once during the assignment, where you try to improve the model developed by Jaidev. The rest of the preprocessing steps and feature engineering will not take a lot of time. This will help you save time as well as resources. The high training time is due to the intercommunications and data transfer that happen between the different nodes of the cluster. **Take caution that you do not exhaust your credits.** 

## Prerequisites

This session requires no prerequisites other than the knowledge that you have gained in earlier sessions and a working knowledge of the PySpark DataFrame API covered in the previous course.
