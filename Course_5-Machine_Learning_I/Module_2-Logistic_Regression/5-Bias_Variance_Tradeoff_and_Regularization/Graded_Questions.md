# Graded Questions

#### Model Variance

Qn: How do you measure the variance of a model?

- By measuring how much does the estimates of the model change on the test data, on changing the training data.

- By measuring how much does the estimates of the model, generated by some other learning algorithm using the same training data, change on the test data.

Ans: A. *Variance measures how much the model changes with respect to the training data.*

#### Training Error

Qn: In principle, it is possible to reduce the training error to zero.

- Yes

- No

Ans: A. *You could always make the model memorise the entire training dataset!*

#### Regularization

Qn: Regularization is a:

- Technique which is used to increase the training accuracy

- Teachnique which is used to increase the model complexity

- Technique which is used to strike a balance between model complexity and model accuracy on training data.

Ans: C. *Regularization does not improve accuracy; it improves the balance between accuracy and complexity.*
