# Introduction

Welcome to the session on '**Logistic Regression (Model Evaluation)**'.

## In this session

In this session, you will first learn about a few more metrics besides accuracy that are essential in evaluating the performance of a logistic regression model. Then, based on these metrics, you will learn how to find out the optimal scenario in which the model will perform the best. The metrics that you will learn about are as follows:

-   Accuracy
-   Sensitivity, specificity and the ROC curve
-   Precision and recall

Once you have chosen the optimal scenario based on the evaluation metrics, you will go on and make predictions on the test data set and see how your model performs there as well.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this session other than knowledge of the previous two sessions.
