# Introduction

Welcome to the session on '**Logistic Regression (Model Building)'**.  
   
In the previous session, you learnt the mathematical concepts necessary to build a logistic regression model as well as the metrics used to evaluate a logistic regression model. In this session, you will develop a classification model, using Python and the scikit-learn and statsmodels library. These libraries already have functions, which have all the necessary code written to build a model. All the mathematical concepts that you have learnt so far will be implemented in the background. 

But before a model is built, a lot of preparation needs to be done, such as sterilising the data,  selecting relevant features, etc. The predictability of a model depends on the quality of the data that it trains on, and so, the preprocessing steps become essential. Also, note the chronology of the model-building process. It will help when you are building your own models and data-driven solutions. 

## In this session

You will learn how to:

-   Build a logistic regression model in Python; and
    
-   Conduct feature selection for logistic regression using:
    
    -   Automated methods: RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) and
        
    -   Manual methods: VIF and p-value check.
        

You will use the 'Telecom Churn' data set in this session to build a model using logistic regression. The model-building process will involve the following steps:

-   Data cleaning and preparation
    
-   Preprocessing steps
    
-   Test-train split
    
-   Feature scaling
    
-   Model-building using RFE, p-values and VIFs
    

Apart from these concepts, you will also be diving deeper into the evaluation metrics that were introduced earlier, such as the confusion matrix. 

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this session other than the knowledge of the previous session and basic Python coding.
