# Summary

Let's summarise what you have learnt in this session,

In this session, you explored the Spark MLlib API  and understood how to perform basic EDA on a dataset. You explored components such as feature transformers, feature estimators, pipelines and their usage while writing your codes in PySpark. In the upcoming modules of the program, where you would be building machine learning models or use MLlib API, you would take references of these feature transformers and feature extractors since they form the basis for data preprocessing.
