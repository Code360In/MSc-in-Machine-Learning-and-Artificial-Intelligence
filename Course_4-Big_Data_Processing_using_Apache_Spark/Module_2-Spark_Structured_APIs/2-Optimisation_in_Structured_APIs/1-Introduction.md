# Introduction

In the previous session, you were introduced to the concept of structured APIs in Apache Spark. The three different abstractions that you have learnt about so far are dataframes, datasets and SparkSQL. You also got an idea of the difference between structured APIs and unstructured RDDs in the previous module and answered a few coding questions on various datasets in order to get a detailed understanding of these abstractions.

## In this session

We will discuss the concepts of dataframes, which will give you a good understanding of optimisation in structured APIs.  You will also be introduced to the workings and architecture of catalyst optimiser, which is the internal optimiser forming one of the major differences between RDDs, and structured data abstractions.
