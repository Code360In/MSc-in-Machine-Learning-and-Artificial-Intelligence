# Solutions for Practice Notebooks from Session 1

You can find the solutions to practice assessments given after session 1 - segment 7 and 8 here

The objective of these assessments is to make you more confident and comfortable with the coding paradigms in Pyspark. So it is highly recommended that you try to solve these assessments on your own and then refer to the solutions given here. These notebooks show one of the many ways in which you can solve the questions; you can always have different ways to achieve the same results so consider these solutions are more of guidelines to solve problems.
