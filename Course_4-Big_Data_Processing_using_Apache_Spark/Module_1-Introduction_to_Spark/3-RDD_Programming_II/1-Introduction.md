# Introduction

In the previous session, you developed an understanding of the programming paradigm of Spark. You learnt about different transformations and actions that can be performed over base RDDs and paired RDDs. This session will now build over that knowledge.

## In this session

As part of this session, you will use the operations that you learnt in the previous session to implement the Word Count problem and the PageRank algorithm using Spark. You have already implemented the word count in MapReduce. So, this session will help you realise the power of Spark based on this problem. Using these two cases, you will learn the following:

- Lazy evaluation in Spark
- Optimisation techniques such as partitioning and caching

The objective of this session is to help you understand the execution environment of Spark, and train you to write optimised queries for faster processing.

## People you will hear from in this session
