# Introduction

In the earlier modules, you got a basic understanding of the Spark framework and learnt about the various operations that you can perform in Spark. You also worked with the low-level abstraction RDD as well as high-level APIs such as Dataframes, Datasets, and SQL.

## In this module

You will learn about the libraries in Spark with the help of two case studies. Please note that Case Study - 2 will introduce you to a few machine learning concepts that you may not understand completely at the moment, but you need not worry, as you will learn about these concepts in detail in the subsequent courses on machine learning. The main objective of this module is to introduce you to the Streaming and the SparkMLlib libraries in Spark.

Let’s hear from Sajan as he explains the contents of this module.

As explained in the video, the module is divided into the following two parts:

- **Case study on Spark Streaming:** In this case study, you will learn how to analyse Twitter's live hashtag data in real-time. The topics that will be covered in this case study are given below:
    1. What is real-time analytics (RTA)?
    2. Introduction to Spark Streaming
    3. Input/ Output connectors
    4. The workings of Spark Streaming
    5. What is DStream?
    6. Window operations
    7. Spark Streaming Context
    8. Spark demonstration on **‘Hashtags Trend Analysis of Twitter Streaming Data’**
    9. Fault tolerance and checkpointing  

- **Case study on recommendation systems:** Here, you will work on a movie-rating data set and learn how to build recommendation systems based on existing user ratings for various movies. This case study will cover the following topics:
    1. What is a recommendation system?
    2. Real-life examples
    3. Introduction to collaborative filtering
    4. Alternating least squares (ALS)
    5. Matrix factorisation and algorithm
    6. Demonstration on ‘**Building a Recommendation System using ALS on a Movie-Rating Data Set’**

Now, let’s hear from Sajan as he explains the flow of the session on Spark Streaming.
