# Introduction

In this session, you will be introduced to an end-to-end case study on the workings of a recommendation system and learn how to build a model for a recommendation system. Let’s start the session with Sajan.

In this session, you’ll learn to build a recommendation system model using the state of the art, alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm.

Let’s hear from Sajan as he explains the contents of this case study.

As Sajan mentioned, the main objective of this case study is not to go into the maths of the different Recommendation Systems but to understand the different algorithms available to work with and implement the ALS algorithm using the SparkMLlib library.

## In this session

You will learn the following:

- Basics of Recommendation system
- Recommendation system: Collaborative filtering.
- Introduction to ALS algorithm
- Matrix factorization in ALS
- Cost function in ALS
- ALS Algorithm and Parallelisation
