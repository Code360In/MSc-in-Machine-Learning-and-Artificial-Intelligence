# Module Summary

You have now completed 2 case studies in this module:

1. **Spark Streaming:** Hashtag analysis on real-time Twitter data
2. **Recommendation System:** Recommending movies using the ALS algorithm

In this module, we have covered many concepts that are quite new, as you have not learnt about some of them previously in this program. Nevertheless, the main motive behind including such new concepts in this module was to just get you familiarised with some basic machine learning concepts so you do not find any concept new and difficult to understand once you jump to the next course.

The main aim of this module is to add some hands-on experience of Spark since we are going to use Spark extensively in the upcoming courses.

Now, let us summarise the entire module with Sajan in the next video.
