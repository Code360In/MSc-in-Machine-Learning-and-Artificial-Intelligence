# Introduction

Welcome to the hands-on session on the recommendation system using the Alternating Least-Square (ALS) algorithm. In this session, you will be given an end-to-end practical demonstration of the ALS algorithm.

The major focus of this session is to build a recommendation system model using the ALS algorithm. To demonstrate the ALS model, you will be required to download the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) data set.

Let us begin the session with an introduction to this demonstration.
